</h2>

<p>At least twice a year, when he came in to Stovepipe Springs to get his
mail and flour, Sagebrush answered to the cognomen of George Beam. This
was one of the occasions. To his acute consternation, he had discovered
that “The Springs” was crowded with life and gayety, for there was a
strange female stopping at the hotel, and another pilgrim was coming in by
stage this same afternoon.</p>

<p>Sagebrush presented a general vista of whiskers, red nose and
nondescript garments, bleached by sun and white with alkali dust; yet it
was his proud boast that he was the only man between Death Valley and the
big bend of the Colorado who kept abreast of the times. Subscribing to
several weekly magazines, he came in once every six months to get the
accumulated copies. Then he sat down and answered the advertisements,
requesting circulars. Thus he had a burro-load of magazines to read for
six months, then a burro-load of circulars wherewith to while away the
next six months—an involved and vicious circle in which Sagebrush was
always trying to catch up with himself. He kept the post office on the
map, however.</p>

<p>“Now, dog-gone it,” he observed to his three patient burros, as he tied
on his grub and magazines and a bundle of postal cards, “you and me got to
hike out again in order to git our correspondence goin’ in peace! Dad
blame this dad-blamed town! What in hell is folks crowding in this country
for, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Haywire Johnson, assistant postmaster and general utility man about the
hotel, showed up in time to answer this query.</p>

<p>“Hi, Sagebrush! Aint you stoppin’ over in town? Things is pickin’ up
right fast. We got a settler yesterday, and we got a tourist comin’
today.”</p>

<p>“That’s jest it,” growled Sagebrush. “A feller can’t have no peace no
more. That makes three women in town now, not countin’ them females over
to José Garcia’s shack.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen!” Haywire laid his hand on the desert rat’s arm. “Where’d
you get that dust you weighed in over to the store, eh? Let’s you and me
go in and talk, Sagebrush. If you aint got no objections to wettin’ down
them whiskers with a mite o’ licker, s’pose we go inside and arbitrate.”</p>

<p>Sagebrush grunted, hitched his three burros to the rail, and vanished
in the hotel.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0.7em;'>Once Stovepipe Springs had been a boom mining
town, but now it was dead and dried out. To west and north lay desert, to
the south lay more desert and the Colorado. To the east was the Chuckwalla
Range—in it and beyond it rich cattle country with water galore. Here in
Stovepipe Springs, and over across the Chuckwallas, men talked different
languages, had different customs and were themselves different. No cow-men
came over this way unless they were well ahead of the sheriff; and
Stovepipe Springs, having its own railroad connections at a distance of
twenty miles, was supremely independent of the remainder of the county,
and heartily despised all ranchers and cow-men.</p>

<p>Here, besides the hotel, were five inhabited houses and two stores, a bank
and a garage. Had it not been for the literary enterprise of Sagebrush
Beam, even the post office would have long since been wiped off the map.
The town was a point of call for desert rats, and being at present on a
detour of the cross-continent automobile highway, had more business than
its looks would warrant. Its inhabitants lived only for the day when some
one would strike it rich and bring back the boom.</p>

<p>It was three in the afternoon and blazing hot when the exhaust whistle
of the autostage announced its arrival. The entire dozen persons of the
local constituency gathered to watch. One of these onlookers was a small
man in rusty and dilapidated attire. He stood barely five feet six, his
face was a grayish mask from which shone two bright and glittery gray
eyes, and there was a stoop to his shoulders—but he was not crowded. He
was not only the most flourishing, but he was the most respected citizen
of all Chuckwalla County.</p>

<p>The stage whooped out a final whistle and came to rest amid a whirl of
dust in front of the hotel. The driver flung off a mail-sack, handed off
an empty express-box, then swung down and vanished abruptly into the
hotel. His solitary passenger, meantime, descended before the assembled
gaze of Stovepipe Springs, staring around with unassumed interest. And
Stovepipe Springs, after the first gasp, stared back—hard.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0.7em;'>The pilgrim was apparently a young man,
though little could be seen of his features. He wore an enormous pith
helmet which shaded his face, tinted yellow goggles which hid his eyes,
and from the collar of his khaki coat to the tip of his nose was wound a
bright green shawl which draped back over his shoulder. Just then Haywire
and Sagebrush came out the side door of the hotel, and Sagebrush halted as
though smitten.</p>

<p>“My gosh, Haywire!” he exclaimed. “What was in that there licker? I
never seen nothing like this before—not even from tequila! Is that thing
really there?”</p>

<p>“She is,” said Haywire, with a startled look. “Wait—it’s goin’ to
talk!”</p>

<p>The arrival had unwound the green shawl, to disclose a mouth and chin
which were certainly square-cut enough for anyone. He glanced around the
circle of staring faces, and his goggles fastened upon the little man in
rusty attire. Toward him the newcomer stepped, met the glittery gray eyes,
and spoke.</p>

<p>“Am I correct in assuming that this is Stovepipe Springs?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yep,” returned the small man curtly.</p>

<p>“Excellent! An admirable spot. I am Percival Henry J. Tompkins, a humble
member of the American Society of Mammalogists, in search of material for
a paper on the fauna of the great American desert.” Mr. Tompkins spoke in
a precise, neatly clipped voice. “I seek a temporary domicile here—”</p>

<p>“Git over to Mormon Wells, then,” snapped the small man.</p>

<p>“You misapprehend my meaning,” said Mr. Tompkins patiently. “I seek
rooms at your hotel, and a guide. I want a man who knows the desert, who
can lead me to the haunts of its creatures. Particularly I desire to study
the habits of the <i>crotalus cerastes</i>.”</p>

<p>With a flick of his shoulders, the small man turned as though to leave.
Mr. Tompkins reached out and laid a restraining hand on his shoulder,
unwarned by the gasp from those near by.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, I am addressing you—”</p>

<p>What happened was startling to see. The little man moved with a swiftness
that the eye could not follow, then stood snarling, his gray mask of a
face glittering with sheer malignity. Tompkins, knocked sprawling half
across the road, rolled over, sat up, and then struggled to his feet. He
stood blinking around.</p>

<p>“That—er—that was a most remarkable thing!” he exclaimed in his precise
tones. “Did somebody run into me?”</p>

<p>With a sneer and a snap of his teeth, the little man turned and
departed toward the bank, which he owned. Haywire drew the old desert rat
hastily aside.</p>

<p>“Look out! Sidewinder’s feelin’ mean today. Him and that female woman
have been talkin’ chicken-ranches, I reckon. Oh, my gosh! Now that there
mistake for a human is headin’ this-a-way—”</p>

<p>Mr. Tompkins, indeed, seemed to sense a general lack of cordiality all
around him, except in the gaping countenance of Sagebrush, whom he now
approached.</p>

<p>“My friend—”</p>

<p>“Pilgrim, don’t bother me!” said Sagebrush defensively. “It jest can’t
be true!”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay three dollars a day to a man who knows the desert.”</p>

<p>Sagebrush changed countenance. So did the remainder of Stovepipe Springs.
There was a general forward movement, but the desert rat was the first to
recover voice.</p>

<p>“You’re done, pilgrim, you’re sure engaged! What was it you wanted to
find?”</p>

<p>“<i>Crotalus cerastes</i>. Undoubtedly you can introduce me to specimens?”</p>

<p>Sagebrush swallowed hard, but had a reputation to sustain, and upheld
it nobly.</p>

<p>“You bet!” he announced promptly. “Lots o’ them specimens up around
Marble Cañon, and over by Lost Waterhole I’ve seen ’em so thick you
couldn’t hardly move without steppin’ on ’em. I’ll take you right where
them things breed, Perfesser.”</p>

<p>The “Perfesser” looked slightly startled, but nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Very well; you are engaged. We shall have to hire an automobile.”</p>

<p>“You got to see Sidewinder Crowfoot about that. He owns ’em all.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Come to my room in an hour, when I have had a chance to
remove the stains of travel. By the way, where is the hotel? I wrote to
engage rooms, but see no hostelry.”</p>

<p>“Right yere under your nose, Perfesser. Hassayamp is takin’ in the
mail—thar he is.&#160;—Hey, Hassayamp! Meet my friend the Perfesser. This is
Hassayamp Foster, Perfesser. The Perfesser’s a bug-hunter, Hassayamp, and
wants a bed.”</p>

<p>“My beds won’t help him none,” said Hassayamp, a lean and melancholic
individual who came forward, chewing a ragged mustache. “I got a room for
you, Puffesser.”</p>

<p>“With bath,” said Tompkins. Hassayamp halted and blinked.</p>

<p>“Bath? Good gosh, we don’t allow no washin’ in the springs this time o’
year! Got to use a cream separator to git enough drinkin’ water. Rains are
over, but they aint filled the springs yet—not for another two weeks, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“I refer, sir, to a bathroom attached,” explained Tompkins.</p>

<p>“Well, there aint none,” said Hassayamp. “Whar’s your grips?”</p>

<p>Two enormous and bulging suitcases, each as big as a small trunk, were in
the stage boot, and Hassayamp hauled them out with antagonistic air, and
led his victim away.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0.7em;'>The Stovepipe House was built for desert use,
not for looks. The front building contained post office and hotel
dining-room; and passing through this, Tompkins descended the rear steps
and found two long adobe structures stretching in front of him, each
divided into cells; between them drooped some parched flowers and shrubs.
He was shown to his cell, a room twelve by twelve, furnished with all the
comforts of home.</p>

<p>“Don’t do no cussing nor singing after midnight,” warned Hassayamp as
he shoved in the two enormous grips, “’cause a lady’s got the next room.
When the bell rings for supper, you show up prompt; my old woman’s liable
to be real ornery if folks don’t ’predate hot vittles. Two-fifty a day.
What did you go tangle up with that old desert rat Sagebrush for? I’d ha’
been glad to pilot you around my own self. Int’rested in mines, are you?
Don’t let him show you no specimens, Puffesser. That old rascal would salt
hell and unload it on a pilgrim. Don’t you trust nobody around here but
me. I got two quartz lodes and a placer location that’ll make your eyes
water—”</p>

<p>“Not interested in mines, thanks,” said Tompkins, cutting short the flow
of talk. “If I saw a good chicken-ranch, I might invest, but not
otherwise. Ever hear of anyone around these parts by the name of Ramsay?
Alec Ramsay. Might have passed through here a year or so ago.”</p>

<p>“Nope,” said Hassayamp, shaking his mustaches. “Well, if ye want anything,
come and holler for it.”</p>

<p>Hassayamp withdrew; in more haste than he had previously displayed, he
ducked around the side of the hotel, rambled down the desert sands of the
nominal alley, and in three minutes was rapping sharply at the back door
of the adobe bank. This was opened to him by the small gray-faced man, who
was no other than Sidewinder Crowfoot. Hassayamp slid inside and closed
the door behind him.</p>

<p>“Well?” rasped Sidewinder. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>“That bug-hunter,” said Hassayamp agitatedly. “What ye think he said?
That if he knowed where there was a good chicken-ranch, he might buy
it!”</p>

<p>A thin smile appeared in the gray mask. “That so? We’ll see about
it.”</p>

<p>“And he asked if I knowed anyone around here, a year back, name of Alec
Ramsay.”</p>

<p>The smaller man started, and his eyes glittered venomously.</p>

<p>“So that’s it—so that’s it!” murmured Sidewinder. “I thought he didn’t
act right natural. By gosh, I’ll look into him!”</p>

<p>“Wa’n’t Ramsay the one,” began Hassayamp, “that bought that there claim
from Mesquite up in Pinecate Cañon, and got mixed up with—”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” snapped the other man suddenly. “Listen to me, now. I’ll
attend to this gent myself, if he needs it. Let him run as far’s his
hobbles will let, for a while. First we got to fix up Miss Gilman. You got
to take her out day after tomorrow—<i>sabe</i>? I’ll have her all primed up
about the location—you sell it to her. Take her up the Chuckwalla road,
then off to Pinecate mesa and up the cañon to that big boulder. Sell her
the same ground we sold that Ramsay fool. There’d ought to be water in it
right now, and it’ll look mighty pretty. Sell her any location she picks
out. <i>Sabe?</i>”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Hassayamp. “And ye needn’t worry much over
that bug-hunter. He’s jest a natural-born fool.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” was the response. “But don’t be too durned sure.”</p>

<p style='margin-top:0.7em;'>Sidewinder’s doubts would have been verified
could he have seen Professor Tompkins at the same moment. Tompkins had
removed goggles and helmet, reveal snapping blue eyes which looked
anything but weak, and close-cropped red hair that spelled trouble. Also,
from beneath his shirt he had produced an automatic pistol, and was now
carefully examining its load. When he spoke to himself, his voice lacked
all the precision and clipped utterance it had displayed in public.</p>

<p>“Confound it, there’s one thing I sure overlooked!” he was musing as he
frowned at a silver plate set into the butt of the pistol. “If I take it
off, dust will get into everything; if I leave it on, I’m running risks.
Well, guess I’ll run risks! If I need you, my friend, I’ll sure need you
real bad.”</p>

<p>The initials on the silver plate were P.&#160;A.&#160;R.—which by no stretch of the
imagination could be made to fit the name Tompkins.</p>

<h2 title='II' id='chII'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>The usually free-and-easy dining-room of the Stovepipe House was
hushed and uneasy when supper came around, before the unwonted presence of
a strange female. Tompkins had a table to himself, and at the next table
was Miss Gilman; there were only two other occupied tables.</p>

<p>Tompkins was interested in his fellow-p’lgrim. She was a young woman;
she was possessed of an indoor complexion; and if not exactly beautiful
she had an air of character and firmness; when she smiled, indeed, as she
did whenever Haywire came to her table with his tray, a dancing light came
into her eyes, and Haywire was straightway confused and flustered. Seated
with his wife at another table was Hassayamp, and Tompkins observed that
the proprietor addressed his better half in a tone of voice intended to
reach other ears.</p>

<p>“Marier, we got to improve on Manuela’s cookin’ ’fore next week, when
them road-workmen git here. I aint stuck on Mex cookin’ my own self. We’ll
be right crowded up with folks workin’ on the highway next week. Mose
Pincus tells me today there’s a feller name o’ Rosenblum comin’ in from
Meteorite, goin’ to open up a army goods store for this here district;
wants him a shack big enough to hold six kids and a missus, and a store
front. Speakin’ as the president of the Stovepipe Springs chamber o’
commerce, I’d say this here town is started on her boom. They tell me
Sagebrush Beam weighed in a right smart o’ dust today, too.
Wouldn’t s’prise me a mite if a rush’d start this way that’d ride Gold
Hills a mile! Dang it, I wisht we didn’t have to ship in these here aigs;
somehow, they don’t taste like aigs should, as I remember ’em.”</p>

<p>Miss Gilman departed, and thereafter Hassayamp essayed no more information
at large. Tompkins, who was decidedly hungry, was the last out of the
dining-room. He came through the post office lobby, performed the delayed
ceremony of registering, and was then escorted outside to the street by
Hassayamp. They found Miss Gilman standing under the sun-shade and
looking up at the glorious sunset that flooded all the sky with gold and
scarlet. She turned at their approach, and Hassayamp performed the
introductions.</p>

<p>“Miss Ethel Gilman, lemme make you acquainted with the Puffesser. You
folks want to make yourselves to home in Stovepipe Springs. We don’t put
on no airs here, and everybody’s sociable. Miss Gilman, she figgers on
startin’ a chicken-ranch and settlin’ in our midst, and I dunno but what
we might make her our school-teacher. This time next week we’d ought to
have six Rosenblums, and we got four little Garcias right now, and Manuela
tells me her brother is liable to come over from Chuckwalla City next
month, and he’s got five more. That looks right healthy, don’t it? Then
take the old Alcora Dance Hall down the street, it’d make a right smart
school, if we fix her up and spill a little paint around and so forth. The
Puffesser is likewise int’rested in hen chickens, Miss Gilman. He’s
lookin’ up bugs right now, but—what did you say your name was,
Perfesser?”</p>

<p>Tompkins cleared his throat and bowed to the young woman.</p>

<p>“Percival Henry J. Tompkins, entirely at your service, madam. May I
solicit the pleasure of your company in a short walk, to breathe the
inspiring evening air and view the noble aspect of the Creator’s handiwork
in the heavens?”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” murmured Hassayamp in awe. Miss Gilman gave Tompkins a curious
glance, as though wishing to peer past those tinted goggles; a smile was
in her eyes, as she made demure assent.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I’d enjoy showing you the sights. You just arrived today?”</p>

<p>“Only this afternoon, madam,” returned Tompkins. “Mr. Foster, if you
apprehend any specimens of <i>crotalus cerastes</i> in the near future, I should
be glad if you would confine and preserve them for me.”</p>

<p>“I’d sure like to, Puffesser,” said Hassayamp, blinking, “but we aint
got a bug in the house. If you was to go up to Garcia’s, you might have
some luck.”</p>

<p>Tompkins waved his hand, and strode off beside Miss Gilman, who seemed
rather red in the face.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0.7em;'>Neither of them broke the silence. They passed down the street, came to
the fast-disappearing rows of ancient buildings, relics of boom days,
and presently were walking along the open desert, following the white road
that went straight as a die across the horizon. The silence became
oppressive, until suddenly Tompkins chuckled and spoke in his natural
voice. It was a drawling, rather whimsical voice, and drew a swift glance
from the girl.</p>

<p>“Our friend Hassayamp is a human phonograph,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ll go too far one of these days,” said Miss Gilman. Tompkins
stopped short and stared at her.</p>

<p>“Eh? Just what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the girl sharply, yet with a laugh in her eyes.
“That red hair and your natural voice and the shape of your head don’t go
with your assumed character, Mr. Tompkins. Take off those glasses and let
me see what you look like. And stop fidgeting with that pipe in your
pocket. Take it out and smoke. I’d like you to.”</p>

<p>Tompkins broke into a laugh, reached up and removed the goggles, and
met the curious regard of Miss Gilman.</p>

<p>“What do you wear them for?” she demanded. “You look better without
’em.”</p>

<p>“Protection,” he drawled, bringing forth his pipe. “You’re an
observant young woman, but I trust fervently that you’ll keep your
observations to yourself. I look very much like another man, and do
not care to be recognized for him—or mistaken for him.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed. “You don’t look like a criminal, Mr. Tompkins!”</p>

<p>“I’m not. I’m really a mammalogist. Now, everybody here is positive that a
bug-hunter is crazy, so I’m making it easy all around by playing up to the
part. You, however, don’t look like a chicken-raiser.”</p>

<p>“But I am—at least, that’s what I’m going to be. I’ve come from Los
Angeles to start a ranch here. Land is cheap; there’s no fog; the climate
is ideal, and for a while I can sell all I can raise right here in
town.”</p>

<p>“D’you mean it?” asked credulously.</p>

<p>“Of course I do. The prospect looks a whole lot better to me than the
prospect of your finding any animals or bugs out on the desert.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know a whole lot about the desert, do you?” he asked, dryly.</p>

<p>“No. Do you?”</p>

<p>“A little.” Tompkins puffed at his pipe rather hard for a moment,
frowning at the sunset, then he came to a halt, and turned to the girl
with an air of decision.</p>

<p>“See here, Miss Gilman, really I don’t want to intrude into your
affairs, but I think that you’re going ahead rather blindly. Are you all
alone here in town?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Her eyes dwelt on his strong, rather harsh
features, with questioning scrutiny. “But I’ve lived on ranches, I’ve
taught school, I have some money saved up—and really, Mr. Tompkins, I’m
able to look out for myself.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not,” he said quietly. Suddenly a look came into his eyes
that made the girl catch her breath, so furious and deeply filled with
passion was it. “You’ve got to get out of here!” he exclaimed with abrupt
anger in his voice. “You don’t know what sort of a place this is—what sort
of men are centered around here! There’s a gang of the vilest murderers
somewhere about Stovepipe Springs that ever saw the light of day! The
whole place is a decoy-trap for the unwary—for people like you! If that
town knew what my real name was, what my errand is here, my life wouldn’t
be worth a plugged nickel.”</p>

<p>Startled by his vehemence, sobered by his words; the girl met his gaze
for a moment, then frowned.</p>

<p>“Why do you speak this way?” she demanded calmly. “I think you’re far off
the mark, Mr. Tompkins. I’ve met everybody since arriving yesterday.
They’re good, simple people—ignorant if you like, but at heart really
fine. I’m afraid you’re an un-American sort of person. Do you regard
everybody outside of New York with the same savage intolerance? Do you
think that because nobody speaks French in Stovepipe Springs, everybody
is a poor hick?”</p>

<p>Tompkins stared at her for a minute.</p>

<p>“Good Lord—my dear girl, get me right!” he exclaimed. “I mean literally
what I say. I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I know what I’m
talking about.”</p>

<p>“What, then—bands of outlaws and robbers?” She smiled ironically,
and the smile stung Tompkins.</p>

<p>“Something like that, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I simply don’t believe you,” she said with quiet finality. “Shall
we go back now?”</p>

<p>“As you prefer. I hope you don’t have any cause to remember my warning
with regret.”</p>

<p style='margin-top:0.7em;'>To this she made no response, and they returned in silence to the
hotel, Tompkins inwardly cursing his very undiplomatic way of presenting
the warning. Upon nearing the hostelry, they encountered Mose Pincus, an
earnest, alert little man who kept the general store, and he immediately
cornered Miss Gilman with a request that she send all orders for chicken
equipment through his agency. Tompkins went on alone to his own place, and
when the lamp was lighted, he picked up his newspaper and went definitely
to work. He knew what to look for now.</p>

<p>It was a Los Angeles paper, which he had bought on leaving the railroad
at Meteorite because it was the latest sheet to be had. Now he searched
the advertising columns, and after a moment chanced upon the very thing he
sought. It was a large display advertisement, and after reading it,
Tompkins clipped it out and then perused it more carefully and with keen
appreciation. It read as follows:</p>

<blockquote style='font-size:0.9em;'>
<p style='text-align:center'>CHICKEN RANCHERS<br />
Come To Chuckwalla County!</p>
<p class='ni mt05'>
No California fogs in this State; an ideal climate for chickens.
Stovepipe Springs will welcome you. Local demand for eggs is heavy. Not a
chicken within a radius of thirty miles in one direction and 250 miles in
all others.</p>
<p class='ni mt05'>
Off railroad but on State highway. Land from $1 to $50 per acre. Taxes
so light they make you laugh. Correspondence invited. The Stovepipe
Springs Chamber of Commerce will coöperate with you in every way; write
the secretary, M. J. Crowfoot, First State Bank, Stovepipe Springs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting the clipping away in his pocket, Tompkins got his pipe going
and puffed for a while in frowning reflection. At length he sighed.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I can’t help her any—and I don’t know that I blame her
for feeling as she does. To all appearance, this is a harmless little
desert town and nothing else. I don’t even know that I’m right; haven’t a
darned bit of proof to lay before her! But this Sidewinder Crowfoot sure
lays a clever trap for suckers. Not a chicken around here, eh? He’s dead
right, at that. What with coyotes, skunks, lynx and snakes, not to mention
rats, any chickens would have a hard struggle. And the advertisement
doesn’t mention water. Hm! I wonder how many poor flies have been drawn
into this spider-net and sucked dry? And I wonder how many poor devils
have gone out into that desert around here and never come back—like my
brother Alec Ramsay?”</p>

<p>He puffed on, a somber frown darkening his keen eyes.</p>

<h2 title='III' id='chIII'>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>When Percival Henry J. Tompkins, mammalogist, walked into the First State
Bank the next morning, he wore his best professorial air.</p>

<p>Moses J. Crowfoot, more generally known as Sidewinder, was his own
banking force, and sat alone at a desk behind a grill which hedged off
most of the bank. He was not afraid of robbers. No professional robber in
the combined areas of Nevada, Utah and New Mexico would have dreamed of
tackling the Stovepipe Springs bank, because Sidewinder Crowfoot was an
old-timer who knew his business. Three amateurs had undertaken the job two
years previously, and each of them received a forty-five slug squarely
between the eyes.</p>

<p>The nickname was highly appropriate. Like his namesake, Crowfoot was
highly venomous, he struck without warning, and he struck to kill; he was
not a pleasant man, and he did not care to be pleasant. He lived alone. In
the old dim days, Sidewinder had been a monte dealer in the Alcora Dance
Hall; when the law clamped down on gambling, he had owned the Oasis
Saloon; when the law clamped down on liquor, he had gone into banking.
Some people would claim this was natural evolution.</p>

<p>He looked up at his visitor without speaking. Tompkins, entirely
ignoring what had happened upon his arrival in town, came forward to the
grill and smiled.</p>

<p>“This, I believe, is Mr. Crowfoot? I have been referred to you, as
owner of the local garage. I desire to rent an automobile with which to
survey near-by areas of the great American desert and pursue my
investigations of the fauna—”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” said Sidewinder curtly. “We only got one rent car, and
that’s engaged. The other’s a demonstrater, and we can’t rent it or we’d
never sell it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Thank you very much indeed,” said Tompkins, and turned to the
door. “In that case I had better buy it.”</p>

<p>Before Sidewinder could call up any suitable retort, his visitor was gone
to the garage next door; before Sidewinder could get there, money had
changed hands and the shiny flivver reposing on the garage floor was the
property of the Professor. Finding himself too late to prevent the
purchase, Crowfoot put on his best air and engaged Tompkins in amiable
talk, while the mechanic in charge filled the car with oil and gas and put
in half a dozen water-bags.</p>

<p>“Hassayamp was telling me,” observed the banker, “that you were askin’
about a man named Ramsay. Seems to me like I recall the feller. Friend of
yours?”</p>

<p>“A mere acquaintance,” said Tompkins. “I met him at Palmdale, on the
other side of the Mohave, while I was engaged in a study of the curious
flora over there. Poor fellow, I felt sorry for him! He had lost one eye,
and was afflicted with tuberculosis, and was at the age of sixty-five with
not a cent in the world. He mentioned that he thought of coming in this
direction to locate, having been here some twenty years ago during the
mining boom.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Sidewinder, with a relieved air. “Then it aint the same one.
The one who went through here last year was a right young feller,
red-haired and active. If I was you, Perfesser, I’d get loose of that
Sagebrush. He aint only a desert rat, and folks tell mighty queer stories
about him. All desert rats are queer in the head, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why—er—that’s very good of you, indeed!” said Tompkins gratefully.
“Still, I have engaged the man, perhaps heedlessly, and must keep my
promises for a certain time. I suppose, if I were to deposit my money and
valuables with you, I’d be in no danger!”</p>

<p>“Right good plan,” said Sidewinder. “Step into the bank, and we’ll
arrange it.”</p>

<p>Tompkins obediently retraced his steps, and when he displayed his two
certified checks and his roll of loose bills, the banker became almost
affable. Tompkins, meantime, was quite conscious that he was being closely
studied, and did not hesitate to shove out all his chips and play the game
of innocence. He agreed at once that the best scheme was to deposit all
his money in care of Mr. Crowfoot, taking the latter’s receipt for it, and
his air of eager gratitude was pleasant to behold.</p>

<p>“Whom would you recommend as a guide?” he inquired, when the transaction
was completed. “After a trip with the person I have engaged, I might find
it advisable to take another cicerone.”</p>

<p>“Right good idea,” said Mr. Crowfoot. “Hassayamp’s a good man—I tell you!
There’s a feller will be in town next week. I’ll speak to him about it.
Harrison, his name is—Mesquite Harrison.”</p>

<p>A slight pallor crossed the face of Tompkins, but he responded gratefully:
“By all means. Kindly engage him for me. I shall expect to use him at
once, and thank you again for your kindness in the matter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” said Sidewinder, and grinned to himself when his
caller had departed. There was no longer any doubt that the Professor was
what Hassayamp proclaimed him—a natural-born fool, like all bug-hunters. No
one else would have handed over his money so readily.</p>

<p class='mt10'>Tompkins walked back to the hotel, and on the doorstep of his own
cell found Sagebrush awaiting him. Inside, with the door closed, the
desert rat chuckled.</p>

<p>“I reckon Hassayamp is right uppity over losin’ the chance to guide ye,
Perfesser,” he announced. “But you done jest right. Hassayamp don’t know
nothin’ about the desert.”</p>

<p>“No?” Tompkins lighted his pipe. “He lives here, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Sho! He’s like José Garcia; let a vinegaroon git on him, and he throws a
fit. No sir, Hassayamp jest plumb aint a desert man. He knows a sight o’
locations. Him and Sidewinder have sold a hell of a lot, too. Folks buy a
place and set awhile, and next time I come in to town, they’re gone.
Thar’s cabins all over betwixt yere and the Chuckwallas, where the ground
has been sold and deserted. Hassayamp hires fellers to prove up on
homestead rights, then buys the homestead off’m ’em and sells it again. He
aint no guide, though. All he knows is roads. Git him off’m the road, or
show him a t’rant’ler in his blankets, and gosh! Hassayamp is worse’n a
tenderfoot. Say, I heard a good one on him this trip!”</p>

<p>Sagebrush chuckled again, spat on the floor, and scratched his whiskers.</p>

<p>“Met up with two fellers in the Salt Pans—ol’ Hardrock Miller from
Tucson, and another feller. Hardrock used to be a Mormon ’fore they run
him out of Arizona for bein’ too durned Mormonistic. He tells me Hassayamp
used to be one too, away over to St. John’s, ’bout fifteen year back.
’Cordin’ to him, Hassayamp vanished real sudden one night, and so did all
the money belongin’ to the church, and several head of hosses belongin’ to
other folks. May not be true, though. Hardrock Miller saved hisself from
bein’ lynched once by tellin’ the truth, and aint never done it since.
Afraid his luck’d turn, maybe.”</p>

<p>Tompkins smiled. “Know a fellow by the name of Mesquite Harrison?”</p>

<p>“Do I?” Sagebrush scowled and spat again. “Is that skunk in town? Then
by gosh, I’m goin’ for him!” The desert rat shot a hand to his waistband,
where there was a swelling about the size of a revolver. “Why, Perfesser,
Mesquite is rank pizen! Yessir. I’ve knowed him to rob prospectors of
their grub—it’s a fact! And once he changed the signs over in the Salt
Pans, so’s a poor pilgrim took his team the wrong way and durned near
died, and that skunk Mesquite robbed him bare. By gosh, anybody who
changes water-hole signs in the Salt Pans gits shot on sight! Mesquite
knows it, too. He don’t come to town when I’m due, usually—”</p>

<p>“He’s not here now,” said Tompkins. “I heard the name mentioned; that’s
all. I’ve bought a flivver, and I wish you’d purchase all supplies
necessary and get them loaded into the back seat. Strap her down good. We
can get off in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” said Sagebrush, a far-away look in his eyes. “It’ll seem lonesome
as hell without them burros—well, s’pose I got to do it. Where we goin’
to?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet.”</p>

<p>“I’d sort o’ like to look over them ledges jest this side the
Chuckwallas—over by Pinecate Cañon,” said the desert rat thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Can we find any <i>crotalus cerastes</i> there?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so. Find most anything there.” Sagebrush inspected his employer
curiously. “Say, you aint so bad a feller when you git off to yourself,
Perfesser. You talk real human. Kind of put on dog when there’s any folks
around, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Tompkins laughed. “I expect I do, Sagebrush. How about water over by that
place you mentioned—Pinecate Cañon?”</p>

<p>“Plenty right now. Rains aint only jest quit. Another two weeks, and we
wont find nary a drap. Cañon ought to look right pretty; too, with the
flowers. The desert sure is handsome this time o’ year. All the bugs
comin’ out,’ too, so’s you’ll feel to home. Lots o’ tumblebugs over by
the mesa and cañon—that’s how come it’s called Pinecate, bein’ the Mex
name for tumblebug.”</p>

<p>“Ever hear of a fellow named Ramsay, who was interested in mines around
here?”</p>

<p>“Nope.” Sagebrush rose. “Well, I reckon I’ll go git them supplies, then
git my correspondence finished today. See you around sunup tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>He departed. Tompkins, left alone, opened his two large grips and began to
pack one of them for the trip. The larger part of the contents consisted
of supplies such as could not be purchased in Stovepipe Springs; there was
even a large alcohol stove with plentiful fuel. The packing finished, from
a secret pocket inside the grip Tompkins took a letter and began to peruse
it carefully, not for the first nor the tenth time. The envelope had been
postmarked “Stovepipe Springs” and bore a date of a year past. It was the
final portion of the letter which attracted the rereading of Tompkins,
however.</p>

<blockquote class='fs09'>
<p>Enclosed is the deed to the property. I am more than satisfied with the
prospects of the location. You will notice that the mining rights revert
to the State in most instances, but here I have bought the land outright
so there is no question of mineral rights. A man called Mesquite Harrison
owned it.</p>
<p>I have seldom seen a more beautiful spot, even after the desert rains,
for it is filled with all kinds of flowers. What a pity that flowers and
water cannot last! Halfway up the cañon there is a huge boulder of pink
granite, split squarely in two, with three piñons growing out of the
split, and a tiny spring trickling from the piñons. Really a marvel! I
understand the spring never fails, though it is too tiny to be of much
use. Well, good-by for this time. I’m going to spend two months at the
location, and if it has any gold I’ll know by that time.</p>
<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:10%;'>Your loving brother,</div>
<div style='text-align:right;  margin-right:2%; font-variant:small-caps;'>Alec.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Tompkins folded the letter and put it away again, then sat down and sucked
at his empty pipe.</p>

<p>“Poor Alec—what happened to him, I wonder!” he muttered. “And not a thing
to go on. Deed to the property lost. No way of finding its location. Never
recorded the deed. How was that deed lost? The letter was mailed here. It
must have been in the letter. Therefore—but I’ve no proof. Hell! Once let
me get a grip on something definite!”</p>

<p>He seized his glasses impatiently, donned them, and left the room.
Outside he almost ran into Miss Gilman. She greeted him brightly.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir! I hope your digestion is better today?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s worse.” Tompkins smiled. “Please remember to say nothing of
my remarks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have no chance,” she returned. “We’re leaving after breakfast
tomorrow. Mr. Foster—otherwise Hassayamp—is taking me over toward those
hills in the east. He knows of a splendid location for my chicken-ranch.
Pinecate Mesa—isn’t that a romantic name?”</p>

<p>“Very,” said Tompkins gravely. “Very romantic. It means tumblebug. I may
be going in that direction myself, so I’ll hope to see you again.”</p>

<p>And before she could say yea or nay to this, he went on his
way.</p>

<h2 title='IV' id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>Sunrise found Haywire serving an early feed to Tompkins and Sagebrush,
while the laden flivver rested out in front of the hotel awaiting them.
Tompkins expected to drive the flivver—in fact, he was forced to drive it.
When they had about finished their breakfast, Hassayamp appeared,
yawning.</p>

<p>“You gents sure are industrious critters,” he observed casually. “Which
way you headin’ for?”</p>

<p>“West,” said Tompkins promptly. “We shall impersiflate the great and
boundless expanses of the arid lands beneath the setting sun.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.” Hassayamp bent a significant eye on Sagebrush. “It’s right
healthy out in the flat country. I got to go east my own self today. Well,
so long, and good luck to you, Puffesser! Hope you find lots of bugs.”</p>

<p>“Travelin’ with me,” said Sagebrush, “the Perfesser wont find nothing
else.”</p>

<p>“I believe it,” returned Hassayamp acidly. “I sure believe it.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ what?” demanded Sagebrush, one hand slipping toward his
waistband.</p>

<p>“Meanin’ that you sure know the desert, o’ course! What else would I
mean?” Sagebrush grunted and departed, while Hassayamp muttered inaudibly
and glared.</p>

<p>Tompkins climbed into the flivver; Sagebrush climbed in after him; and
with a roar the little car started out of town. One mile north of
Stovepipe Springs the main highway turned abruptly to the right, for the
Chuckwalla range, and beyond it, the civilized purlieus of Chuckwalla
City, thirty miles away. The desert highway continued on ahead, and ran, a
flea-bitten track, straight over the northern horizon.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” asked Tompkins as they rattled out of town, “you never
happened to meet up with a large pink granite boulder, halfway up a cañon,
split in two, with three piñons growing out of it, and a little spring at
the foot of the piñons?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” said Sagebrush after a moment. “Nope, can’t say that I have, but
that don’t signify much. Aint no piñon trees around yere except toward the
Chuckwallas. Pink granite is most anywheres. I’m right disappointed you
aint headin’ east. I’d kind o’ set my notions on looking over that there
Pinecate section.”</p>

<p>Tompkins chuckled. Then, as they approached the turn in the highway, he
swung the car to the right and headed for the distant peaks of the
Chuckwallas.</p>

<p>“That’s where we’re going, Sagebrush.”</p>

<p>“How come you told Hassayamp—”</p>

<p>“Because I was telling Hassayamp.”</p>

<p>Sagebrush grinned, got out a black plug of navy cut, and bit happily at
it.</p>

<p>“You and me sure is goin’ to get on, Perfesser. Whoop her up!” Then he
grunted. “You heard what he said ’bout it bein’ healthy out to the desert?
Durn him! Durn him and Sidewinder and all the rest o’ them galoots! They
been tryin’ to keep me out o’ the Chuckwallas for quite a spell back. I
bet Hassayamp’s got some claims over there hisself.”</p>

<p>“Why have they been trying to keep you out of there?”</p>

<p>“Dad-blamed if I know. Jest plumb ornery, I reckon. Maybe they’re afraid
I’d meet some o’ the pilgrims they gets located over there, and talk. They
allus locates some over there this time o’ year, when there’s lots o’
water and things look good.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Tompkins, who had removed his yellow blinders, squinted out at
the desert with frowning eyes, and drove on in silence. He was reasonably
sure that in Sagebrush Beam he had chanced upon the one man who might be
of incalculable value to him. However, he was not disposed to take any
premature chances. His own real business here was a matter for himself
alone.</p>

<p>The flivver ate up the miles rapidly, ever advancing upon the
Chuckwalla hills, which appeared to recede as it approached. To one
acquainted with the desert only from the window of a railroad car, this
morning’s ride would have been a tremendous surprise. Under close
inspection, what appeared to be ground flat as a billiard table was shown
to be in reality dissected by almost invisible arroyos and crowned by
slight rises. The blinding white desert glare was in fact a spectrum of
brilliancy, only visible to accustomed eyes. The eastern horizon was
barred by the Chuckwallas, a rather high range which on their western
slopes presented only a bleakly dun expanse streaked with purple. To west
and north were scattered buttes in splendid colorings of scarlet and
lavender and gold, while the patches of cacti across the desert floor made
brilliant carpet-spots of vivid green, sprinkled with the raw yet blending
hues of an Oriental rug. Here were ocatilla sprays, towering up many feet
in glowing blossom; here were opuntias gorgeous with red and yellow
clusters, gaunt Joshua trees gay with bloom—all the brief flower-time of
the desert was at its height. In a few more days the blossoms would be
gone, the myriad flowers springing from the earth would be withered, and
the white glare would break only over the brownish-green verdure of brush
and cactus in summer garb.</p>

<p>Hot as that glare might be, the motion of the car kept its occupants
comfortable; and the flivver itself, specially equipped with water-pump
for desert use, made no complaint as the miles dropped behind. Now and
again Tompkins asked a question, Sagebrush responding curtly. Garrulous as
he was at times, the old desert rat was for the most part silent as the
desert itself, whose quiet was broken only by the angry chattering of
cactus wrens or the occasional shrill call-whistle of a thrasher.</p>

<p>Twenty miles had been covered, and the Chuckwalla slopes, apparently as
distant as ever, were now broken up into foothills and deep cañons, all a
dead dun glare under the white sun, when Sagebrush touched the arm of the
driver.</p>

<p>“Half a mile ahead the trail branches off to Pinecate Mesa. That’s it,
off to the left—reg’lar saddletop. Look out for a dry wash, soon’s ye
leave the road.”</p>

<p>Tompkins looked at Pinecate. This was a great gaunt saddleback that ran
off into the range; he set it down as about ten miles distant, and well to
the left. The cañon which gave access to the mesa itself was, as Sagebrush
informed him, on the north side and therefore out of sight at present.</p>

<p>The turnout was almost invisible, but Tompkins caught it, swerved the
car into the looser sand, and was aware of a grunt of assent from beside
him. Then he jammed on the brakes and slid into a “dry” wash which at the
moment was a foot deep in water, splashed through, and climbed out on the
other side.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” spoke up Sagebrush. “Let’s have a look at this yere
trail.”</p>

<p>The car halted, and both men got out. Here, off the highway and
sheltered by the mesquite on either hand, die loose earth would bear any
“sign” indefinitely, for nothing less than a sandstorm would wash over the
tracks. Sagebrush examined the sand attentively, then expectorated and
turned to Tompkins, who had donned his yellow blinders as a protection
against the glare.</p>

<p>“What d’ye make of it?”</p>

<p>“Automobile,” said Tompkins. “How long ago, I can’t say.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Sagebrush grunted, at this, and pointed to a series of
scroll-like markings which followed the right-hand tire-rut. Then
he indicated further prints in the shape of a Maltese cross, which had
obviously been made over the scrolls.</p>

<p>“Flivver come along yere yestiddy,” he stated. “Last night a sidewinder
come along and follered the ruts. Then this mornin’ early a roadrunner
come along likewise.”</p>

<p>“All obvious but the time, Sherlock,” said Tompkins gravely. “How do
you know it was yesterday and not last week?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I seen that thar cuss Hassayamp ridin’ out this-a-way yestiddy
mornin’ as I was comin’ in to town to mail my postcards. Some
skullduggery goin’ on.”</p>

<p>“Hm!” Tompkins frowned. “Sagebrush, that mesa up ahead would make a
fine place for a chicken-ranch, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hell of a fine place,” affirmed the desert rat, squinting at the long
saddleback. “Danged fine place, Perfesser! Every wildcat and coyote in the
Chuckwallas would be pointin’ that way, inside of a week. If a gent was
feelin’ real philanthropic and wantin’ to help out the pore desert
critters, I’d say start him a chicken-and-egg factory right up yonder.
Yessir. That’s like Haywire Johnson done, time he was livin’ down to
Meteorite. He started him a egg-ranch—done it to get ahead of some other
folks and kep’ it real quiet. Got all his chickens clear from Phoenix and
Yuma, danged near a hull carload of ’em, and set up incubators and all
that truck. Then he begun to figger on how rich he’d be. Every oncet in a
while he’d go out to look for eggs, but dad blame if he got any. He fed
them chickens on everything from ground-up lizards to eggplant, and nary a
egg come along. Finally he got desp’rit and called in help—and durned if
all them birds wasn’t roosters! Yessir, not a female chicken in the lot.
That’s how come Haywire went broke and had to come over yere to work for
Hassayamp.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Tompkins grinned despite himself. Then he sobered.</p>

<p>“Look here, Sagebrush. Remember that young woman at the hotel? They’ve
framed up a deal on her. They’re trying to sell her a chicken-ranch on
this mesa.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like them city fellers. Dad blame, they’d rob a dyin’ man!
Serves the female right, too, for havin’ that much money. Females aint
got no right to have money. Oncet when I was married and livin’ down to
Umatilla, my ol’ woman got ten dollars from one of her relations and went
to Phoenix, and durned if she didn’t spend it all in three days. When I
trounced her for it, she up and run off with a Mormon from Yuma, and
that’s the last of her. Twenty years ago that was, and I been happy ever
since, and ain’t looked twice at no females.”</p>

<p>“That’s a novel argument, certainly,” said Tompkins. “But I’m going to
try and keep Miss Gilman from getting robbed. Are you with me?”</p>

<p>Sagebrush rubbed his whiskers, squinted at the sand, expectorated over
an unwary Chuckwalla lizard, and then responded without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Nope! Quicker that there female gits skun and gits out o’ this
country, better off I’ll be. I don’t hanker after no females spoilin’ the
scenery. Besides which, I aint pinin’ to start no argument with Sidewinder
Crowfoot and his crowd, not without they force me into it. Leave the other
feller alone, I says, so long’s he don’t crowd ye none.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said Tompkins briskly, and turned to the car. “Let’s
get moving.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>They drove on in renewed silence. Tompkins had a new angle on
his companion, and was not sure that he liked it; at all events, he
perceived that Sagebrush knew his own mind and was not to be depended upon
as an assistant under the present completion of things. The desert rat had
a certain peculiar philosophy of his own, like all old prospectors, and
arguments against it would be as useless as the teeth of a coyote against
the shell of a tortoise. So Tompkins held his peace.</p>

<p>The flat desert gave way to hills and depressions as they drew closer
to the range, and by the action of the engine Tompkins knew that they had
been on a steady climb. Also, he began to sight scattered piñon trees,
indicating a higher altitude, and was conscious that they were following
an ancient road. Presently the car was climbing along a well defined
valley, which Sagebrush called Mint Cañon.</p>

<p>“Ol’ stamp-mill ahead of us,” he announced. “Fellers used to bring
quartz down to it from all around, in the ol’ days. Got to leave the car
there. Job Carter put up that there mill; four-stamp crusher, she was—dad
blame, how Job did like his licker! Used to make mint juleps in a bucket.
That’s how come he growed mint. Job, he used to whiff the mint and then
throw down the licker while he held his breath. One night he wakes up with
a pain in his stummick and mixes him a julep in the dark, and got him the
cyanide bottle by mistake, and he’s buried somewhere back o’ the mill
right now. That’s what comes o’ not stoppin’ to appreciate your licker as
it goes down.”</p>

<p>They rounded a low hill and halted by the remains of the stamp-mill—a
structure of weather-beaten boards, open in front, with the remains of a
shed adjoining. The machinery was rusted and strewn about the place
haphazard, and the whole place was the epitome of desolation. To one side
was a board floor—the only relic of what had once been a roadside saloon,
adjoining the mill.</p>

<p>Sagebrush pointed out that by leaving the car here in shelter of the
shed, they could then shoulder packs and cover the last three miles to
Pinecate Cañon on foot. The Professor took one look at the duffle in the
rear of the car, and threw in the gears.</p>

<p>“Not by a blamed sight!” he said cheerfully. “Looks like Hassayamp’s
car has gone ahead, so we’ll do likewise. Did I mention that Hassayamp is
bringing Miss Gilman out today to look over the cañon for a chicken-ranch
site?”</p>

<p>“Dad blame it!” groaned Sagebrush. “Then I’m goin’ to take my pick and
go look over the north end o’ the mesa. You can pester around that female
if ye like, Perfesser, but not me. Send up a smoke when they’re gone and
I’ll come in.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” and Tompkins laughed as he sent the car ahead in
the faint tracks left by the other flivver.</p>

<h2 title='V' id='chV'>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Noon was passed and over. Tompkins, ensconced in a niche of the cañon,
was delightedly observing the scene before him. Sagebrush was gone. The
flivver was laid up out of sight a half-mile away in a thicket of cactus
and piñon.</p>

<p>It was peaceful here in the cañon, and hot. Tompkins lay shaded by an
overhanging rock which concealed him and enjoyed himself while he waited.
He was a third of the way up the cañon, which wound upward for another
mile before opening on the mesa. Here it was fairly wide, and the sun had
excellent chances to radiate from the boulders, and the spring life of the
place was warmed into activity. Patches of cacti and jack-pine abounded.
No water was in sight, but Tompkins had a water-bag within reach.</p>

<p>He lay perfectly quiet, watching a trade-rat whose nest lay in a cranny
of the rocks just to one side, and a young coyote which was vainly
endeavoring to investigate the rat and nest. It was obvious that this
particular rat had migrated from the desert below, for while his nest was
composed of pebbles and sticks and all manner of queer objects, it was
protected after the peculiar fashion of his desert brethren. Two runways
entered the nest, itself nearly out of sight under the rocks; and about
these runways, laid with mathematical precision, were hundreds of terrible
opuntia joints.</p>

<p>To Tompkins, as to every other naturalist, it was an unsolved mystery
how the pack-rat, with delicate and unprotected paws, could handle these
joints of cactus. No other living creature can face the <i>cholla</i> cactus,
whose spines, as the Indians declare, jump at one, inflicting acute agony;
even the rattler avoids it gingerly. Here for a space of ten feet around
the nest were heaped the matted <i>cholla</i> joints, while the pack-rat who
owned the establishment sat out in full sight and insulted the hovering
coyote with angry taunts.</p>

<p>That the coyote was young and hungry was obvious, or he would not have
attempted to molest so well-entrenched a rat. Oblivious to the presence of
Tompkins, who sat perfectly motionless, he charged again and again on
those defenses. Each time his courage failed at the last moment and he
would draw off, snarling and snapping in futile rage, before his nose
touched the <i>cholla</i>.</p>

<p>In a cool niche between two rocks, in sight of Tompkins above but
concealed from the furious coyote, lay a fifteen-inch sidewinder, safely
sheltered from the deadly rays of the sun, his brown-and-gray length
practically invisible against the rocks. He lay stretched out, head lifted
ready to strike, a venomous and malignant thing beyond all words with his
horned features and green jewels of eyes. The coyote, unconscious of this
lurking death, continued backward and forward, now rushing and now sending
a flurry of sand flying in his anger. One such flurry had aroused the
sidewinder, and Tompkins waited for the inevitable, since the coyote was
drawing closer and closer to the unseen death.</p>

<p>Now it came, with such rapidity that the eye could scarcely follow.
Pawing the sand, the coyote came sidewise toward the niche of the
sidewinder, then went forward in another rush, stopped short, snarled, and
took courage again. His leap brought him past the niche; and the
sidewinder, after the fashion of his kind, struck without warning or
coiling. There is nothing swifter than the strike of a sidewinder—but the
coyote saw the lurking death just in time. A frantic yap of fear broke
from his jaws. He gave a desperate twist sidewise in midleap—a doubling-up
of his body that evaded the reptile’s blow—and in mad panic came down and
leaped again, blindly. He landed squarely in the matted <i>cholla</i>.</p>

<p>Agonized howls rent the air, and sticks and bones and odd objects from
the pack-rat’s nest were hurled about; the coyote became a whirlwind of
furry agony from which proceeded howl upon howl of anguish. Then, tail
between legs, wailing to high heaven with every leap, the wretched coyote
went down the cañon like a streak and was gone.</p>

<p class='mt10'>Tompkins caught up the stone under his hand and hurled it,
then rose. Crushed, the sidewinder lay quivering. A glittering object had
caught the eye of Tompkins, and now he raked it forth from the cholla with
a long stick. It was one of the mass of objects which had formed the rat’s
nest, flung about by the agonized flurry of the coyote. When he had it
within reach, Tompkins picked it up and stood staring at it, incredulity
and horror mingling in his eyes. It was a small tarnished cigarette case
of silver, and upon it he made out the initials “A.&#160;R.”</p>

<p>“The case I gave Alec for Christmas two years ago!”</p>

<p>The words died on his lips. It was the property of his vanished brother
Alec Ramsay. Holding the case in his hand, he stared over the desolate,
empty cañon until the heat of the sun roused him. He stooped, donned his
pith helmet, and then looked again at the metal case. Mechanically he
pressed the spring, which refused to work. Taking out his knife, Tompkins
pried the case open—and beneath the spring-holder discovered a folded
paper, on which was scrawled in pencil the writing of his brother.</p>

<p>His blurred eyes cleared. At the top was written:</p>

<blockquote class='casenote'>
<p>Send this to Pat Ramsay, Glendale Apts. Denver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And below, scrawled more sharply, but ending with an uncertain
dash:</p>

<blockquote class='casenote'>
<p>Dear Pat: Forgot to mail this. Too late.
They got me. Shot through lungs. 3 men in party. Bad gang
here. All located Hourglass Cañon, N. E. of here. Box cañon. Cholos and
whites. Sidewinder—</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was all. Lips compressed, Tompkins read and reread this fateful
message, which now he knew to be a message from the dead. Then, in that
cold certainty, he opened the folded paper and found it to be a deed, made
out by Mesquite Harrison to Alec Ramsay.</p>

<p>“By glory—the deed to Alec’s mining property!” he ejaculated, as he
conned the writing therein. Then, when he had finished reading, he folded
up the deed, replaced it in the cigarette case, slipped the case into his
pocket, and stood staring up the winding reaches of the green cañon.</p>

<p>That property was located in this very cañon. Stunned as he was by
surprise heaped on surprise, he realized this only too clearly. His
brother was dead. The property in question had been bought from Sidewinder
Crowfoot for whom Mesquite Harrison had acted as a blind. It lay somewhere
up there toward the mesa—marked by that split pink granite boulder,
perfectly described in the deed as to bounds and extent. It was this
identical cañon for which he had come searching so blindly. Had he gone on
around the next bend, he would have found the boulder with its piñon
trees.</p>

<p>Tompkins sank down and took his head between his hands, striving hard
for sanity. His first impulses were not sane at all; they were murderous.
His brain was seething in tumult. He was not red-headed for nothing.</p>

<p>By slow degrees his thoughts settled down into grim coherence. Now he
knew what he had long ago presumed to be the case—that his brother was
dead. But here in his pocket was evidence as to who was responsible. There
was no direct evidence against Sidewinder Crowfoot, but Tompkins brushed
this impatiently aside; he was perfectly convinced that Crowfoot was the
man behind everything going on here.</p>

<p>“At the same time, I’ve got to be sane—got to be!” he thought
desperately, fighting for self-control. “I can’t go off half-cocked.
They’ve got brains. They’ll get me if I let out a peep. Nothing but my own
brains will save me now, and if I don’t go slow, I’m a goner sure! This
changes my whole program. Now I know everything—and it’s up to me to get
busy. First thing to do is to get back to town and get this deed
recorded—send it in by registered mail. The stage goes out in the morning,
so any time will do for that. Chuckwalla City is the county seat; might
run over there in the flivver, only I’d better see Sidewinder Crowfoot,
get my money, and sever connections. And I’ll want a rifle, before I go up
against that crowd in Hourglass Cañon, wherever it is. Then—”</p>

<p class='mt10'>He was abruptly startled from his reflections by an eager
hail, and looked up to see Miss Gilman approaching, with Hassayamp
trailing behind her. He had forgotten the girl, and now an exclamation of
dismay broke from him. Then he rose, donning glasses and helmet again, and
nervously lighted up his pipe.</p>

<p>“We didn’t see you till we were almost on top of you,” exclaimed Miss
Gilman.</p>

<p>“Were you asleep? What makes your face look so white?”</p>

<p>“A touch o’ sun, madam. No, I was not asleep. I was watching the
peregrinations of yonder pack-rat. Not so fast, Mr. Foster—there is a
large <i>crotalus cerastes</i> just by your left foot.”</p>

<p>“A which?” demanded Hassayamp, by no means pleased to see the
professor.</p>

<p>“I believe you would term the reptile a sidewinder—”</p>

<p>“Oh, my gosh!” Hassayamp saw the dead snake and did an acrobatic stunt
that removed him some distance away, while a revolver came out in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” said Tompkins. “He’s dead. I killed him.”</p>

<p>“Why in hell didn’t you say so first?” snapped Hassayamp angrily. “What
you doin’ up this-a-way? Thought you was headin’ into the
sink-holes?”</p>

<p>“I changed my mind,” said Tompkins. He showed Miss Gilman the
pack-rat’s nest. “That’s worth seeing. I have a particular reason for
asking you to remember it. But may I inquire whither you two are
heading?”</p>

<p>“Up the cañon to look at a chicken-ranch site,” said the girl, glancing
from him to the nest and back again. “Will you come along? Or don’t you
feel well? Really, you looked almost ghastly at first, Mr. Tompkins!”</p>

<p>“Reckon the climb would be too blamed hard on the Puffesser, ma’am,”
struck in Hassayamp, who did not desire company. “And there aint no bugs
up there.”</p>

<p>“All the more honor in discovering some, sir! I accept your invitation,
madam, and shall accompany you a little way.”</p>

<p>“We’ve brought lunch along, if you’ll join us,” invited Miss Gilman,
starting off again with Tompkins at her side. He glanced around and saw
that Hassayamp had paused to wipe a dripping brow and bite off a fresh
chew, and was momentarily out of earshot. Swiftly, he took the
cigarette case from his pocket and passed it to the girl.</p>

<p>“Open this and read it—quick, now! I found it in that rat’s nest. When
I tell you my real name is Pat Ramsay, you’ll be able to guess why I came
here—and whether my warning was well founded. Read the deed carefully,
then see whether the place you’re going to buy corresponds with it.
Quickly! I’ll hold this rascal engaged. Read and give it back to me. I
must get back to town at once.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>With this rapid utterance, he turned abruptly from the
girl and walked back to Hassayamp, halting the latter’s advance with
upraised hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Foster!” he said solemnly. “May I inquire, sir—ah, that is a very
interesting creature on your collar, very interesting indeed!”</p>

<p>Hassayamp screwed his head to look at himself, but could see
nothing.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded nervously. “A beautiful little creature,
peculiar to our deserts,” said Tompkins in bland accents. “Undoubtedly it
has sought refuge from the sun under your shirt-collar. You know, of
course, that the <i>solpugid</i> is really an insect, having tracheal tubes
instead of the spider’s book lungs—”</p>

<p>“A spider!” exclaimed Hassayamp. “Git it off’m me, Puffesser,
quick!”</p>

<p>“Not a spider at all, my dear sir, and quite harmless, I assure you,
despite local superstition. Ah, there it goes about your collar—no wonder
the dear little creatures are called wind-scorpions or vinegaroons—”</p>

<p>“A <i>matavenado</i>—wow! My gosh, git him off’m me!” Hassayamp let out
a yell and began to claw at himself. “I’m a dead man—git him off’m
me—”</p>

<p>Tompkins seized him and brushed vigorously at his back.</p>

<p>“There—he’s gone. Pay no more attention to the matter, I implore you. I
was about to ask whether you ever indulge in spiritous liquors, Mr.
Foster? In such case, I have in my pocket a small vial of medicinal
whisky. I understand that it is the custom in the desert to offer a
drink—”</p>

<p>Hassayamp, who like many another man with slight experience of the
harmless but frightful-looking vinegaroons believed them to be deadly
creatures, was pale with emotion. And with more than emotion, too.</p>

<p>“If you got a drink, Puffesser,” he implored, “for gosh sake give it
here! I swallered my plug.”</p>

<p>Tompkins produced a small pocket flask and began to unscrew it.
Hassayamp became yet more pale and agitated.</p>

<p>“Oh, gosh!” he groaned. “I’ll never eat no more tobacker—”</p>

<p>He reached out and took the flask. He sniffed it, and into his
melancholic eyes came a glow of warmth and happiness. Tompkins beamed upon
him, as he lifted the flask.</p>

<p>“I forgot to mention, Mr. Foster, that you must use your mustache as a
strainer, because in that whisky I am preserving a very fine specimen of
rock scorpion which I recently discovered, and I should be very sorry to
have it lost—”</p>

<p>Hassayamp jerked the flask from his lips. He looked at the Professor
with slowly distending eyes, then thrust the flask at him; and, with one
agonized groan, retired among the near-by boulders.</p>

<p>Tompkins turned and rejoined Miss Gilman.</p>

<p>“Hassayamp will rejoin you shortly,” he said. “He unfortunately
swallowed his chew of tobacco—an accident which will unnerve the strongest
man, I assure you—” The girl looked at him with strained and anxious
eyes.</p>

<p>“But this—this paper! Do you mean to tell me that this man Alec Ramsay
was your brother?”</p>

<p>Tompkins nodded quietly. “Yes, Miss Gilman. I came here to trace
him—and by a stroke of sheer luck I found this cigarette case. You have
read that deed? Then I advise you to go on up the cañon and see if the
description fits. I haven’t been up there. Be very careful to say nothing
to Hassayamp about this. I’ll see you tonight, if I may, and we’ll talk
over what is to be done. Now I must get off—you’d better keep a sharp
lookout for rattlers among these rocks. Don’t wait for Hassayamp; he’ll be
along as soon as he’s able. <i>Hasta la vista!</i>”</p>

<p>She made no response, but stood gazing after him thoughtfully as he
turned and departed.</p>

<h2 title='VI' id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>As Tompkins climbed down the rock-strewn cañon toward the thorny
growth which hid the flivver from sight, he came to a decision upon his
course of action, forcing himself to determine upon a caution which was
distasteful and yet necessary.</p>

<p>“<i>Hasta mañana!</i>” he resolved. “Until tomorrow, at least, I must
remain Percival and so forth Tompkins—and then I’ll become Pat Ramsay once
more, and get into action. The damned murderers! I wonder how many men
have gone the way of poor Alec? I wonder how many people have been decoyed
into this spiderweb to lose everything they had? Alec must have gone
investigating, must have discovered the headquarters of this gang—and so
they finished him. He’s probably lying somewhere up that cañon now. Well,
time enough to look him up; just now I’ve got to watch my step mighty
close.”</p>

<p>He was now assailed by the problem of locating Sagebrush, since he
could not well run off with the car and leave his companion to rusticate
in the desert solitudes. As he came in sight of the patch of piñon and
cactus which enshrined the flivver, he caught no sign of the desert rat.
He knew that he could recall Sagebrush with a smoke, but this he did not
desire to do unless necessary.</p>

<p>When he drew near the clump, he perceived Hassayamp’s flivver on the
other side, with strips of canvas flung over the tires to protect them. An
unusual object beneath this car attracted his attention, and upon closer
approach he discovered it to be no other than Sagebrush. He gave a hail,
and the old desert rat crawled out into the sunlight.</p>

<p>An exclamation broke from Tompkins, and he hurried forward. The left
arm of Sagebrush was out of its shirt-sleeve and roughly bandaged, and the
bandage was dark with blood.</p>

<p>“What happened?” he demanded. “How’d you hurt yourself, old-timer?”.
Sagebrush clawed at his whiskers and flung the inquirer a pained
look.</p>

<p>“You got it plumb wrong, Perfesser,” he observed. “I aint been
meanderin’ around these parts for fifteen year or more ’thout leamin’ how
not to hurt myself. I aint no pilgrim, by gosh!”</p>

<p>“My humble apologies,” said Tompkins dryly. “May I ask, then, who hurt
you?” Sagebrush grinned.</p>

<p>“Another of these yere smart gents who think that ’cause a man’s a
prospector and don’t wear galluses, he’s a babe in arms. I aint right
certain as to this feller’s name, but when I was over to Mohave six months
ago, I seen a picture of him in the sheriff’s office. Name was Joe
Mendoza, or some such <i>cholo</i> name.”</p>

<p>The speaker enjoyed hugely the bewilderment of Tompkins.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean you had a scrap, Sagebrush?”</p>

<p>“Nope.” Sagebrush expectorated, wiped his lips and grinned. “I was
peckin’ away at a ledge in a cañon a couple mile east of yere, when durned
if that feller Mesquite Harrison didn’t come ridin’ down the cañon on a
hoss! Yessir! Right on top o’ me, ’fore I seen him, too. He started
throwin’ lead, and I covered up, and ’fore I could git into action, the
coyote was gone. Then along come another feller that I hadn’t seen, this
yere <i>cholo</i>, and durned if he didn’t pick on me too. But I was ready
for him, you betcha! I gives him jest one crack from ol’ Betsy,”—here
Sagebrush patted his waistband significantly,—“and he flops. I walks over
to him and seen he looked like this <i>cholo</i> Mendoza, and then I come
back yere and set down to rest a spell.”</p>

<p>“Killed him?” asked Tompkins curtly.</p>

<p>“Hope so. He was some dead when I left him, anyhow, but you never can
tell ’bout them <i>marihuana</i>-eaters. I knowed a <i>cholo</i> over to
Mormon Wells, oncet, that et <i>marihuana</i> and smoked it likewise.
Fin’ly one night he got plumb filled up on it, and jumped into the corral
and begun to slash the hosses with his knife. Sheriff and two other
fellers sat on the bars and pumped lead into him for as much as five
minutes, but he didn’t quit till he’d slashed every hoss there; then he
quit. Sheriff allowed he’d been dead with the first shot, but the
<i>marihuana</i> had kep’ him goin’, same’s a rattler keeps a-twitchin’
till sundown after he’s dead. That there hop is powerful stuff,
Perfesser.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Tompkins stood staring at the desert rat for a moment.
Then:</p>

<p>“The whole gang will be after you now, wont they?”</p>

<p>Sagebrush gave him a queer look. “How come you know so durned much,
Perfesser?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m here to know,” snapped Tompkins suddenly. “Remember my
asking you about a boulder with piñon trees growing out of it? Well, that
place is up yonder in Pinecate Cañon. My name isn’t Tompkins at all. It’s
Pat Ramsay. Last year my brother Alec came over here to spend a year in
the desert and clear up his lungs. He bought a place and vanished—clear
vanished, and couldn’t be traced. The last heard of him was from Stovepipe
Springs. He wrote me about a place he had bought, describing that boulder.
I found this up the cañon in a pack-rat’s nest. Look it over while I get
the car ready.”</p>

<p>He gave the cigarette case to the staring desert rat, then turned and
went back to his own car. When he got this out of the brush, he removed
most of the load and hid it securely among the trees. This done, he
returned to Sagebrush, who was sitting on the running-board of
Hassayamp’s car examining the deed.</p>

<p>“Anything I can do for your arm?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nope. Bone aint hurt. Say, Perfesser, you’ve sure struck me all of a
heap! Still, I knowed you wasn’t the danged fool you looked.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Tompkins laughed curtly. “Now, Sagebrush, I’m going to town,
speak easy to everyone, and slide back here. First I want to investigate
that Hourglass Cañon, wherever it is—”</p>

<p>“I know where it is,” said Sagebrush, scratching his wealth of
whiskers.</p>

<p>“All right. Where do you come in on the program? Want to be left out?”</p>

<p>Sagebrush produced his pipe and sucked at it. At length he made slow
answer.</p>

<p>“Perfesser, there’s some folks around here jest pining to be left
alone, and most gen’ally they gets left alone. That <i>cholo</i> Mendoza
was one such, and killin’ him aint botherin’ me none. Most likely you’ve
discounted Sidewinder Crowfoot?”</p>

<p>“My guess is that he’s the head of the whole gang.”</p>

<p>“Reckon ye aint far off. Now, so long as I aint bothered, I aint
troublin’ nobody. My motter is never to bother a rattler what’s a gent and
sounds his rattles—but if he acts like a sidewinder, then bash his head,
and do it pronto! Yestiddy you asks if I’ll help keep this yere female
from gettin’ skun, and I says no. I still aint int’rested nohow. But two
of that danged crowd have set in on me with a cold deck this mornin’, and
I’m plumb riled. Yessir, I’m riled!”</p>

<p>Sagebrush stood up. His bent figure straightened a trifle, and a sudden
savage expression showed in his eyes, half masked behind the hairy growth
of whiskers. In a flash all his dirt and squalor, all his unkempt and
sun-bleached appearance, was gone in the eyes of Tompkins; he saw there a
desert man who cared nothing for externals, but who could cope daily with
the bitterest and most fearful forces of nature—and who was now ready to
turn his inward strength against men. The drab and plodding desert rat
suddenly showed, for one flashing moment, what unsuspected depths of
character lay within him; and a rush of anger unbarred the floodgates of
his reticence.</p>

<p>“Yessir, I’m riled! I’ve seen them goin’s-on and said nothin’. I’ve
seen them outlaws rulin’ the roost around yere and said nothin’. ’Twan’t
no skin off’m my nose. I hadn’t no call to butt in. I’ve seen folks come
in yere right happy, and seen ’em go out skun and mis’able and busted.
I’ve seen one feller after another come in yere with the law two jumps
behind him, and he goes over to Hourglass Cañon and lives happy. No law
reaches in yere; nobody dast to interfere; and nobody knows about it
anyhow. Stovepipe Springs, dad blame it, is jest a blind! If any
law-off’cer comes pirootin’ around, he gits steered plumb careful and goes
away ’thout learnin’ nothin’. But now, by gosh, I’m riled! Yessir.
Perfesser, I’m with ye six ways from Sunday. Them skunks have sold us
chips in this yere game, and by gosh I’ll play them chips till hell
freezes over! Name your ante, Perfesser, and let’s go.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Sagebrush relaxed. He stuck his pipe in his pocket, brought out his
plug and bit off a large section. Tompkins, taking the cigarette case and
pocketing it, nodded.</p>

<p>“Good. I’m going to get a rifle in town and come back tomorrow morning
without anyone suspecting what I have in mind. Then I’ll be Pat Ramsay
once more. Want to go to town with me?”</p>

<p>“Reckon not,” said Sagebrush reflectively. “Mesquite was headin’ for
town, and him and me would sure collide. That might spoil your hand. And
say! I remember that brother o’ yours. I seen him with Mesquite one time.
He looked a heap like you do ’thout them spec’s and all.” Tompkins produced
his pocket flask, opened it and held it out.</p>

<p>“Here’s to our luck, Sagebrush! Good hunting!”</p>

<p>With a grunt of delight, Sagebrush lifted the flask and absorbed his
share of the contents; Tompkins finished it off, undisturbed by any
thought of rock scorpions, eyed the empty glass container, and with a
laugh tossed it into the clump of trees.</p>

<p>“Then I’m off. I’ll be back in the morning. Have to send that deed to
be recorded. Anything you want from town?”</p>

<p>Sagebrush wiped his lips and nodded.</p>

<p>“Yep. There’s jest one feller there ye can trust—Haywire Johnson,
up to the hotel. Register that deed and send by him and tell him to shet
up about it. Otherwise, that durned Hassayamp will poke his nose into it.
Then tell Haywire to give you that there gun he’s keepin’ for me. I don’t
aim to carry more’n one gun these days, not havin’ much use for it, and
Haywire has been keepin’ my other one. I’ll mosey up this yere cañon and
have breakfast ready for ye in the mornin’. Git out early.”</p>

<p>With another nod, Tompkins climbed into his car, started the engine,
and started away. He knew well enough that Sagebrush would carefully avoid
meeting Hassayamp and Miss Gilman.</p>

<p>What most stirred in his mind, however, as he headed for town, was that
mention of his brother and Mesquite Harrison—and Mesquite was now in town.
Taken in conjunction with Crowfoot’s recommendation, here was a chance not
to be missed.</p>

<p>“I’ll sure interview Mr. Harrison and give him the time of his life
before I’m done with him!” thought Tompkins, and he glanced at the sun.
“Hm! I can get to town and clean up everything before supper. Then I’ll
want to see Miss Gilman. She must be persuaded to get out of here at once.
Hm! Queer how old Sagebrush showed up. To all appearance, he’s a
comic-supplement character; put him on a city street and he’d gather a
crowd—but how many of that crowd would last a week with him on the
Mohave? These smart Alecs back East who think Europe is better than
America and who part their hair the way the Prince of Wales does it, and
who look on everyone west of Newark, N. J. with supreme contempt—wouldn’t
I like to see ’em get out in the desert with old Sagebrush, though! They’d
find out what sort of man it was who made this country what she is.”</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that in undertaking to play a lone hand against
the Hourglass Cañon gang, he was likewise carrying out certain traditions
of Americanism.</p>

<h2 title='VII' id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>The First State Bank of Stovepipe Springs had no banking hours, but
was open whenever Sidewinder Crowfoot was there. It was nearly supper-time
when Percival Henry J. Tompkins entered; and Sidewinder gazed at him in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Thought you were off bug-hunting!”</p>

<p>Tompkins shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“I regret to say, sir, that the man whom I had engaged proved to be an
unworthy rascal. I refer to Mr. Beam. In common parlance, he was drunk,
insisted on taking me in the contrary direction to that which I desired,
and even threatened me with a revolver. I abandoned him in the desert, but
had I not encountered Miss Gilman and Mr. Foster, I might never have found
my way back to town. Here is your receipt, sir, and I shall have to
withdraw my money temporarily until I can recompense Mr. Foster for his
assistance and make certain purchases. Tomorrow I hope to start off again
with a new guide.”</p>

<p>The glittering gray eyes of Sidewinder were masked for a moment, then
shot up.</p>

<p>“That’s right good news!” he exclaimed. “That feller I recommended to
you, Mesquite Harrison, is here in town right now. Want to see him?”</p>

<p>“By all means!” said Tompkins gratefully. “If he can come to the hotel
later on this evening, I shall be very glad—or, let us say, early tomorrow
morning. I shall be up with the sun, and I trust early rising will not
discommode him?”</p>

<p>“None to mention,” said Sidewinder, and took an envelope from his safe.
“Here’s your money. Bring back what you got left tomorrow, and we’ll take
care of it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you—thank you very much,” said Tompkins, and departed.</p>

<p>Halting at the garage to see that fresh supplies of fuel were put
aboard the flivver, which he left standing in the street, he walked on
down to the hotel and found Haywire Johnson in the office, alone. Mr.
Tompkins produced a ten-dollar gold-piece and laid it under the eyes of
the startled Haywire.</p>

<p>“Want to earn that, partner?” he asked in his natural voice.</p>

<p>“Gosh, yes!” said Haywire promptly. “Whose mail d’ye want?”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s. Give me an envelope and some sealing-wax.” When he was
supplied, Tompkins wrote a short note, inclosed with it the deed to Alec
Ramsay’s property in Pinecate Cañon, addressed the envelope to the
recorder in Chuckwalla City, and sealed it up. Then he gave it to
Haywire.</p>

<p>“Register this, and slip it into tomorrow morning’s mail-sack without
giving Hassayamp a squint at it. That earns the first ten.” Tompkins now
produced a second gold-piece, at which Haywire goggled frantically.
“Here’s another you can earn. Go over to Pincus’ store and buy me a rifle
with a box of cartridges—”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Puffesser!” broke in Haywire, quickly. “I got one I’ll sell
cheap. Good gosh, yes! Five year old, but better’n they make ’em now.
Distance sights.”</p>

<p>“All right. Sneak it into my room with a box of cartridges to fit, and
I’ll pay you for it; bring along that gun you’re keeping for Sagebrush
Beam, too. He wants it. There’s the other ten. You’ll earn it by keeping
your mouth shut real tight. And listen! Will you or Hassayamp be on deck
along about sunup in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Hassayamp wont; that’s certain,” said Haywire, staring at Tompkins.
“I’m liable to be, if ye want me.”</p>

<p>“All right. You know Mesquite Harrison? He’s coming to see me. Bring
him right to my room, savvy? Then if you hear him yell, be deaf in both
ears, and if you see anything funny going on, be blind in both eyes.”</p>

<p>“All right, Puffesser. Gosh, ye don’t talk like the same feller ye
was—”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Your job is to be a human sphinx. Supper ready?”</p>

<p>“Bell’s just about to ring, Puffesser. I’ll be along d’rectly.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Seeking his own cell, Tompkins enjoyed a thorough wash-up,
and before he finished heard signs of life in the adjoining room which
tokened that Miss Gilman had returned. On his way to the dining-room he
encountered Hassayamp, looking more melancholy than ever, and was given a
cheerless nod; then a flicker of interest seized the hotel-proprietor.</p>

<p>“Say, Puffesser! Thought you aimed to stay awhile in the desert?”</p>

<p>“So I did, Mr. Foster,” said Tompkins blandly. “So I did. But I regret
to say that I had trouble with my companion. Perhaps you observed that I
was alone when we met each other this afternoon? Luckily I was able to
follow the tracks of your car back to town, or I might have been lost. I
trust your stomach trouble has quite passed over?”</p>

<p>“More or less,” said Hassayamp, and went his way.</p>

<p>Tompkins went in and dined heartily, now confident that even if
Hassayamp and Sidewinder got together in conference during the evening,
they would be unable to figure him out to any great extent.</p>

<p>When Miss Gilman appeared at her table, she gave Tompkins a smiling
nod, and he perceived that her day on the burning sands had done its work
well.</p>

<p>“Cold cream is recommended,” he exclaimed. “May I inquire whether you
will view the beauties ol the sunset this evening in my company,
madam?”</p>

<p>“I shall be charmed—Perfesser,” she responded, and Tompkins
grinned.</p>

<p>There was no sunset to view that evening, however. When they met in
front of the hotel, a keen wind was coming down off the Chuckwalla hills,
and clouds had appeared like magic in the sky. They walked together in
silence toward the deserted buildings of the old boom town, until Tompkins
spoke.</p>

<p>“We’ll have snow upon the desert’s dusty face in the morning. Old Omar
Khayyam sure had been there! I’ve seen an inch of snow on the Mohave at
sunrise, and it’d be gone in an hour. This is probably the tail-ender of
the season—rains are all over now. Well, how did you find everything up
the cañon?”</p>

<p>“It was just as described in that deed,” she said soberly. “Oh, I’m
sorry for the way I spoke the other night! I didn’t think it could be
possible, Mr.—shall I call you Tompkins or Ramsay?”</p>

<p>“Neither one,” he responded with a whimsical smile. “Call me Pat.”</p>

<p>“No. I think you don’t need any encouragement to impertinence.” And she
laughed. “But really—that cañon was a dream of beauty! There was water,
running and in pools, and all sorts of lilies were there, and
flowers—”</p>

<p>“Sure, a regular desert cañon after the rains,” said Tompkins. “And not
very far away, a dead man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean that! I didn’t want to think of your brother
as—”</p>

<p>“I’m not talking about him. Another man.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>She gave him a startled look. “You mean a man was killed out
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and another wounded. Several are going to be killed in the near
future, if I’m any judge. You needn’t look alarmed about it, Miss Gilman;
they’re outlaws. I’ve opened up the whole situation pretty well, I think.
Now, I hope you’ll take my advice and get out of this town tomorrow
morning on the stage. I expected to be gone about sunrise, as I have work
waiting for me out yonder, but if you think you’ll need any moral backing
in drawing out of the game, I’ll stay and see you through.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” she returned quietly. “I’m staying.”</p>

<p>“After what I’ve told you and showed you?” he said with a frown.</p>

<p>“Yes. Now let me explain, and don’t get too bossy. Hassayamp wanted to
sell me that claim belonging to your brother; it’s one of the most
beautiful spots I ever saw. However, I made some excuse about it not being
suited to chickens, and I’m going to buy the five acres adjoining it and
just above. You wait till you see that place! It’s got—”</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” said Tompkins, “don’t you know chickens can’t be raised
here, without large and expensive precautions?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not quite a tenderfoot. Chickens or not, I’m going to own that
piece of land! And I’ve taken warning from you, too, because I’ll not turn
over the money until the title is clear and the deed recorded. The five
acres cost me three hundred dollars, mineral rights and all. Hassayamp
owns it. He showed me where a mine used to be—it’s played out now.
I don’t care a bit if the place is never any real good to me; I’m going
to keep it just to live on when I get old, and enjoy it. Why, you get a
wonderful view from the upper cañon out over the desert!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tompkins reluctantly, “since your eyes are open, I can’t
of course make any more objections, though you can buy plenty of desert
cañon for less money. But what about transport?”</p>

<p>“I’ve bought Hassayamp’s car. It’s an old one, but I know all about a
flivver and it will do me. Then, I’m going to get a big tent set up
there—”</p>

<p>Tompkins groaned inwardly, but presently changed the subject. It was no
use whatever to raise up practical objections; the girl would have to find
things out for herself. She was obviously determined on her course, and
the more he saw of her, the more he began to feel that she was a pretty
competent young woman. In fact, as they walked and spoke of cabbages surd
kings, he was distinctly and unpleasantly surprised to find that it had
grown dark and very cold, and that they must return to shelter
immediately. When they had reached the adobe cells that constituted the
hotel, he paused at her door and shook hands.</p>

<p>“From now on, Miss Gilman, my name’s Ramsay—only you’ll come to
calling me Pat, especially if we’re to be neighbors. If you have any need
of me, don’t hesitate to summon me. I believe Haywire Johnson is a good
sort, and you may confide in him any time. And by the way, if you hear any
queer noises early in the morning, don’t call for help.”</p>

<p>“I usually don’t,” she said, smiling. “Why?”</p>

<p>“One of the men who murdered my brother is coming to call on me, I
hope.” The smile died on her lips. Her eyes widened on him.</p>

<p>“You mean it? But—but surely you—you don’t intend—”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a talk; that’s all,” said Tompkins. “Good night,
and pleasant dreams! I’ll see you again. Don’t forget to look through your
blankets for stray lizards.”</p>

<p>He went on to his own cell, and in twenty minutes was sound
asleep.</p>

<p class='mt10'>With dawn, Tompkins, or as he was now to become, Pat Ramsay,
wakened to a glorious sunrise just breaking over a transformed world. As
he had predicted, snow had come during the night. Everything was covered
with a soft white garment, unusual but by no means unheard-of in the
desert, which would be gone again in an hour.</p>

<p>He shaved and made his ablutions and got ready to travel. He inspected
the rifle which Haywire had left in his room, and found it good. He was
still looking it over when Haywire himself knocked at the door.</p>

<p> “Say, Puffesser! Mesquite is out there—” “All right, bring him right
along. Hold on! I want to settle with you for this gun. And where’s that
revolver that Sagebrush wanted?”</p>

<p>“Got it right here, Puffesser—”</p>

<p>Taking the old forty-five that was handed him, Ramsay paid for his
rifle and then swiftly made ready for his visitor. He pulled down the
blind of the window, partly darkening the room, then rubbed his face with
talcum powder and seated himself without glasses or helmet, with his back
to the door, the rifle in his hand. After a moment came steps, then a
knock.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said.</p>

<p>Mesquite Harrison stepped into the room and stood blinking at the swift
transition from snow-dazzle to this obscurity. He was a cadaverous person
with straggling mustache and rudimentary chin, adenoidal mouth and
projecting front teeth; his entire countenance was stamped with
viciousness and weakness, and one glance showed Ramsay that his ruse was
bound to succeed.</p>

<p>“Heard ye wanted a guide,” said Mesquite.</p>

<p>“I wanted you,” said Ramsay, “and I came back to get you.”</p>

<p>He swung his chair around so that the light struck his face.</p>

<p>Mesquite Harrison uttered one low gasp, and then stood absolutely
petrified, struck into helpless, motionless silence. His mouth opened, and
his piggish eyes widened into round disks. He stood with hands thrown back
against the door, and a ghastly pallor crept across his horrified
countenance.</p>

<p>“Thought you were safe when you knew I was dead up there in Pinecate
Cañon, didn’t you?” said Ramsay, in a hollow voice. “You thought that
after shooting me through the lungs you were safe, eh? But you’re not.
I’ve come back to get you! Don’t move a muscle, or I’ll put a bullet
through you.”</p>

<p>His likeness to the vanished Alec Ramsay was strong—so strong that the
wretched Mesquite Harrison made no query about how a ghost could shoot a
rifle. This interesting conundrum was about the farthest thing from
Mesquite’s mind at the moment. His distended eyes were fastened in horror
upon the face of Ramsay, and now a low wail broke from him.</p>

<p>“Leave me be, fer Gawd’s sake!” he howled. “It wasn’t me! It was Cholo
Bill and Tom Emery done it—I was jest trailin’ along with ’em that day! It
was Tom Emery fired that shot! Leave me be and I’ll be good—”</p>

<p>He plumped down on his knees, and his teeth began to chatter with
fright.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Ramsay in contempt. “Get up! Turn around and walk out
that door and walk out to the street. Then start going—and keep going.
Head for Meteorite, and don’t stop. I’ll be right back of you until you
get there. You can’t see me after we get out of town, but I’ll be there.
Get going!”</p>

<p>The unhappy Mesquite lost no time in obeying. He flung open the door,
darted outside, and started for the street. Ramsay followed more
leisurely. When he passed through the hotel front, he saw Mesquite
standing outside, staring back, and as Ramsay appeared in his wake, the
thoroughly frightened rascal uttered another howl and started for
Meteorite.</p>

<p>“Don’t ever come back here or I’ll get you!” called Ramsay, and the
last he saw of Mesquite Harrison, the latter was plugging along through
the snow, head down and arms going as he ran. Ramsay turned a back into
the hotel office, and met the stare of Haywire.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” said the latter. “What’d ye do to him, Puffesser?”</p>

<p>Without replying, Ramsay went on back to his room. There he got his
belongings together and carried them to the car, which was standing in the
street. While he was putting them into the flivver, he saw Hassayamp
appear at the front door of the hotel, yawning mightily. Ramsay
jerked off his glasses and sun-helmet, and went up to Hassayamp. In the
latter’s startled gaze he read instant recognition, for this was the first
time Hassayamp had ever seen him without the yellow goggles.</p>

<p>“Listen here!” said Ramsay, tapping melancholy Hassayamp on the arm
and boring into him with stern gaze, “I suppose you thought that
little escapade of yours back in St. John’s, Arizona, a good many
years ago, had been forgotten, eh?”</p>

<p>Hassayamp turned white. Whether or not he recognized his interlocutor
as singularly like the vanished Alec Ramsay in looks, he certainly
recognized the remarkable change of voice and manner in the supposed
professor. Mention of St. John’s brought the pallor to his cheeks. Over
his shoulder gaped Haywire, intensely interested.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Ramsay, “it hasn’t been forgotten, my friend. One of
my errands here was to remind you of the occurrence. If I were you, I
wouldn’t rely too much on the protection of Sidewinder Crowfoot. The theft
of horses may be forgotten with the years; but what about that church
money you stole, eh?”</p>

<p>“I—I’ll pay it back,” stammered Hassayamp, now convinced that the
Mormons were on his trail.</p>

<p>“You wont get the chance. If I didn’t have other and more important
fish to fry, I’d attend to you right now. But I guess you’ll keep until I
get back. Then you’ll come along with me.”</p>

<p>Hassayamp turned yet whiter. The Southwest has by no means forgotten
the days of Mountain Meadow and the avenging angels of Mormon; and while
in these more settled times the followers of that faith are certainly
guiltless of any ill-doing, there is an heritage of uneasiness that
lingers about the very name of Mormon and will not be stilled.</p>

<p>So Ramsay strode out to his car, donned goggles and helmet, and went
chugging away to get his breakfast at Pinecate Cañon.</p>

<h2 title='VIII' id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Sagebrush, who had camped at the entrance of the cañon, listened with
hearty approval to Ramsay’s recital of the morning’s events. His roar of
laughter echoed back from the rocky walls and went thundering away up
toward the mesa.</p>

<p>“Durned if I’ve laughed so much since my ol’ woman run off!” he
exclaimed. “Shootin’s too good for that coyote Mesquite, anyhow. He’ll run
into jail to Meteorite, ’cause he’s wanted there for robbin’ an Injun off
the reservation last year. Yessir! That’s how mean that pesky critter is.
Done robbed an Injun squaw what had been sellin’ beadwork to tourists on
the trains.”</p>

<p>“Do you know those men he mentioned as the actual murderers?” queried
Ramsay.</p>

<p>“Nope. Never heard o’ Cholo Bill—most likely he’s a halfbreed greaser,
same’s that cuss Mendoza. Tom Emery’s different. He’s a bad man, real bad.
Got out o’ jail in Arizona two year back, murdered a rancher in the White
Mountains, and skipped out. I reckon there’s a reward for him.”</p>

<p>“All right. You collect all the rewards—what I’m after is
scalps.”</p>

<p>“That suits me, Perfesser. She goes as she lays. What’s the
program?”</p>

<p>Ramsay, having finished his breakfast, lighted his pipe and
considered.</p>

<p>“The thing to do, of course,” he said tentatively, “is to apprise the
nearest legal officers of conditions, get the sheriff to work, and round
up the gang.”</p>

<p>Sagebrush eyed him askance, in no little astonishment.</p>

<p>“Is that there your program, then?”</p>

<p>“No.” Ramsay’s blue eyes twinkled. “No, it isn’t. I only mentioned it
as the proper thing.”</p>

<p>“If we all done the proper thing, this would be a hell of a world,” and
Sagebrush sighed in relief. “I nominates that we light a shtick out o’
yere, go over to that there Hourglass Cañon, and clean her up. Everybody
there is wanted, you betcha!. We don’t need no warrants, nor no officers
fussin’ around to see things is done right.”</p>

<p>“Nomination seconded,” said Ramsay promptly. “How far is it from here?”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” warned the desert rat. “This aint no picnic party,
Perfesser. We got to git busy ’fore Sidewinder gits busy, but there’s no
sense to rushin’ things. We can’t take no autybile over there. We got to
hike. Ground’s durned rocky and rough. Yessir! We’re headin’ east on a
rough and rocky road, and no mistake. That’s one reason nobody aint never
follered none o’ that gang to the roost. Nobody much hint been along this
yere range for ten or twelve year—she’s got the repytation of havin’
petered out. You and me can prob’ly git there sometime tonight, ease up
the cañon, git the lay of the land toward sunup, and git into action. Wipe
out the hull durned batch!”</p>

<p>Ramsay frowned. “That’s a trifle bloodthirsty, isn’t it? I want those
two murderers; if I can get ’em alive to stand trial, all right. If
not—”</p>

<p>“They’re all in the same kittle,” snapped Sagebrush. “Wipe ’em out!
Yessir! I’m riled. But no sense goin’ too fast. We got to see who’s there
and how many, and what things look like. That there cañon is shaped like
the figger X, and where the lines cross is a right narrer gap. The back end
is a box cañon, all right, with durned steep walls and lots of timber.
Only green spot this side o’ them hills. Last time I was there was ten
year back, when Chuck Martin busted his whiffletree, and we rode over yere
to find a new stick. We had some liquor along them days, and Chuck he took
a drap too much and went to sleep in an ol’ shack, and when he woke up it
was dark, and they was a hull passel o’ ’phoby skunks holdin’ a carnival,
and Chuck busted up the dance ’fore he knowed what it was. Gosh, I can
smell him yet when I think of it. Yessir, ‘Look ’fore you sleep’ is a
dad-blamed good rule to foller in these ol’ shacks—and anywheres else too,
I reckon. Well, I’ll git the packs made up while you clean camp.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>The two men set to work. After the flivver was laid out
of sight in the clump of piñon trees and thorny mesquite, the loads were
assembled, and within twenty minutes the partners were on their way. What
with grub and blankets, rifle and water-bag, Ramsay had all the weight to
carry that he wanted, and he faced the prospect of a full day in rocky
desert ground with a grimace.</p>

<p>His expectations were entirely fulfllled. Sagebrush led the way,
skirting the high and precipitous mesa for a time and then striking
directly off toward the hills to the northeast. The abundance of rocks
showed Ramsay that no flivver could hope to cover this ground; the snow
had all vanished long since, and no trace of moisture remained
to mark its passing.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Ramsay, the old desert rat was used to the slow burro
pace, and shuffled along at a steady plodding gait which was not difficult
to sustain, and which ate up the distance slowly but surely. To anyone not
used to it, there was something terrible in the thought of thus shuffling
across the desert day in and day out for years, eternally seeking the
yellow dust; and yet men did it, hundreds of them, and were not happy
unless doing it.</p>

<p>Pat Ramsay faced the project which lay ahead of them, unblinking the
facts, and not shirking what was to be done. He now knew what before he
had only conjectured. Impossible as it seemed, he knew it to be true. Here
at this back door of civilization existed a number of men whose business
in life was robbery and if necessary murder—an abnormal situation, to be
handled with other than normal methods. Ramsay was no innocent in the
waste places. He knew that in these vast stretches of desert country there
existed strange things, that in this apparently empty basin of forgotten
seas there were still unsolved problems and undiscovered wonders. If he
was to go seeking the men who had murdered his brother, he must put away
all thought of haling them before the bar of justice; the only justice
which obtained in the desert was that of the strong hand and the
inexorable requisitions of nature. If men offended the laws of nature, a
terrible punishment was exacted from them. If they offended the laws of
man, as they did every day, the ordinary machinery of man’s justice could
not always reach them—and they knew it.</p>

<p>“By gosh,” said Sagebrush, when they halted at noon in the shade of a
towering pinnacle of rock, “ye done a good stroke when ye got to work this
mornin’ and cut off Sidewinder from them fellers yonder! Yessir! I’d think
twicet or maybe three times ’fore I tackled that there gent. Most likely
that cholo and Mesquite rode in to git supplies, and cuttin’ them off was
a right smart piece o’ work. Wisht we had a hoss apiece! Sing out next you
see a nice fat chuckwalla. I’d like to git me a good chunk o’ lizard-tail
for supper, Per-fesser.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Before they had left the overhanging rock, indeed, Sagebrush located a
fine big lizard and staged a battle royal. The lizard, ensconced in a rock
cranny, inflated himself and could not be dislodged for all the tugging of
Sagebrush, who in the end was content with taking the tail. This the
chuckwalla gladly surrendered, and Sagebrush stowed it away in his pocket
after Ramsay refused to share the delicacy.</p>

<p>The afternoon drew on. They did not hurry; yet the ground was covered
steadily, and no moving object broke the dun expanse of glaring rock and
sand. Gradually they approached a patch of green high on the hills, which
served as landmark, but the entrance to Hourglass Cañon itself did not
open up before them. When the sun was drawing down to the western horizon,
Sagebrush halted.</p>

<p>“No use goin’ on now—we’ll be in the cañon in half an hour and can’t
take no chances. Goin’ to be a clear night, and cold as hell. Why don’t
preachers make hell a cold place, Perfesser? Dad blame if I can see
anythin’ ornery in hell the way it’s laid out. I bet it aint no hotter’n
the Ralston Desert up in Nevada, and that don’t stack up noways alongside
what Imperial Valley used to be ’fore they started growin’ melons and
garden truck there. Reckon I’m goin’ to freeze tonight ’thout no fire, but
can’t be helped. Let’s git our victuals washed down, and then we’ll mosey
along and take it easy till dark.”</p>

<p>When the sun was down, they moved on again, and before the last of the
daylight died into the starry radiance of night, Ramsay descried the lines
of the cañon opening out from the general mass of hills ahead. The night
was clear, with a thin green-silver crescent of moon hanging high, but
nothing could be seen of the environment, though old Sagebrush plodded
along without a pause. A little later he broke into speech.</p>

<p>“Trail. No talkin’, now. Watch out underfoot.”</p>

<p>A trail indeed—at least, a path beaten by the hoofs of horses.
Sagebrush had need to mind his own warning, for the next moment he jumped
sharply aside, dropped his pack and picked up the nearest rock to crush a
sidewinder in his path. After this both men kept a sharper watch for the
nocturnal reptiles than on the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>They had proceeded perhaps two miles when Ramsay found the cañon walls
closing in ahead, apparently forming an unbroken barrier. Then he began to
appreciate the strategic value of the place, which to anyone on the search
would appear to be an empty cañon, while in reality there was a narrow
passage opening into a second but completely hidden cañon. This was a
freak of erosion and wind-carving, for the trail led them sharply to the
right, and then into a black hole—a widening cleft in the rock, ten feet
in width and twenty through to the other side. Sagebrush halted his
companion and stole forward cautiously, then summoned Ramsay. The opening
was unguarded.</p>

<p>Passing through, both men came to an astonished halt. They stood in an
almost circular bowl which, so far as the deceptive light told them, was
not more than a mile in diameter, closed in by gigantic walls of rock
which, on the side opposite them, presented only blackness which was
illumined by three yellow pin-points.</p>

<p>“Lamps,” said Sagebrush. “Got some shacks over there, by gosh!”</p>

<p>It was not this which had startled them both, however. In their
immediate vicinity were great masses of jumbled rock, fallen from the
walls that hemmed in the entrance. At a distance of fifty feet from them
the scattered rock and sand gave place to a thick green carpet which
seemed to cover the entire bowl, and across this carpet moved masses of
horses, quietly grazing.</p>

<p>The explanation was simple. Just now, immediately after the rains, this
hidden box cañon was saturated with drainage from the slopes above and
behind. Either the growth of grass here was natural, or as was more
likely, it had been sown by the occupants of the cañon.</p>

<p>“Set,” said Sagebrush, slipping off his pack and squatting down. Ramsay
followed suit, and the desert rat softly elucidated the situation.</p>

<p>“We got things straight now, Perfesser. This yere crowd is right
happily located, for a fact! The idee is, they slide acrost the hills to
the Chuckwalla range and slide back with a few hosses picked up over
there. When they get a right good remuda, they drive ’em over to the
railroad at Meteorite, or maybe up north acrost the Salt Pans to Silver
City. They keep ’em yere maybe six months till the hair’s growed out over
the rebrand, and by that time everybody’s give up looking: they prob’ly
git a lot o’ foals, too.”</p>

<p>“With a base of supplies at Stovepipe Springs, they’re safe,”
commented Ramsay. “And Sidewinder Crowfoot is the brains of the outfit.
All right. What d’you want to do?”</p>

<p>“Sneak up and look things over. Better let me do it when we git right
close. Then I’ll come back yere and lay up in these yere rocks with both
guns handy. You cut around and open fire on them shacks. You’ll jest
naturally catch ’em penned up, and if they git away, I’ll catch ’em yere.
If they don’t bust loose, I’ll come over and help you. How’s that strike
ye, Per-fesser?”</p>

<p>“First rate,” said Ramsay. “What does Tom Emery look like?”</p>

<p>“Red whiskers. Can’t miss him. Let’s mosey along.”</p>

<p>They rose, picked up their loads, and set forth.</p>

<p class='mt10'>In the darkness of the upper cañon, with the stars
glimmering far above, the scout was made, and all things considered, it
was a good scout. But when it had been ended, the two men drew off
together for consultation, upon both of them settled a silent
consternation. For here was a factor they had not reckoned on.</p>

<p>Three cabins, and in one of them four men sitting playing cards, a
lantern swinging from a rafter. One was Tom Emery—a brutal giant of a man
with a great fringe of flaring red whiskers and matted red hair, a
murderer and escaped jailbird with a price on his head. One, whom old
Sagebrush did not know, was a swarthy halfbreed, doubtless the Cholo Bill
mentioned by the dying Alec Ramsay—a slender, furtive man, on the surface
all smiles, and all deviltry beneath. The third card-player was identified
as Gentleman Jimson, an elderly man with handsome, ascetic features and
the general air of a benevolent preacher. He had escaped from a California
penitentiary three years previously, where he was serving a life term for
murder and forgery. The last of the four men was a pure Mexican, one
Manuel Ximines—a scowling, sullen scoundrel from below the border, a
murderer of women. Not all this had given the two friends pause, however,
but the shrill wail of an infant from one of the other shacks, and the
thin voices of two Mexican women.</p>

<p>“Women everywhere. Aint it hell?” demanded Sagebrush, when they
were at a safe distance. “And now what?”</p>

<p>“Walk in on the four of them,” said Ramsay promptly. “And we have
’em.”</p>

<p>“Nope. Them cholo women would jump us in the back in a minute. Then, if
anything went wrong, the bunch would scatter in the darkness. We don’t
know the lay o’ the ground.”</p>

<p>“All right. Then stick to our original plan.”</p>

<p>Sagebrush dissented with a grunt. “Pardner, it means the females fight
with the men. Now, I jest naturally can’t abide that notion nohow. When it
comes to puttin’ a bullet into a female, I pass. We got to sep’rate them
fellers from the females.”</p>

<p> “Granted,” assented Ramsay at once. “How?”</p>

<p>“There aint but one way out o’ this yere cañon—the front way. Let’s you
and me go back through that hole in the wall and wait. If anybody comes,
we got him; if anybody leaves, we got him. Then, come sunup, we lights a
fire out beyond. They see the smoke, and most likely that feller Ximines
comes out to investigate. We got him. The other fellers come out
when he don’t return—and we got ’em all.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Ramsay. “Let’s go.”</p>

<h2 title='IX' id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>All that night coyotes howled dismally upon the hills; and Ramsay,
stretched out beside Sagebrush near the “hole in the wall,” wakened from
time to time at their almost human cries.</p>

<p>The scheme proposed by the old desert rat was simple and promised to be
highly effective. It had only one drawback, common to all human
propositions—it failed to take into account the dispensations of
Providence, not anticipating the unexpected.</p>

<p>The misty gray darkness that precedes dawn was over everything when
Ramsay, on watch, awakened Sagebrush, and the desert rat sat up,
shivering.</p>

<p>“Gosh, it’s cold!” he observed, throwing off his blankets and pulling
on his boots. Thus finishing dressing operations, he rose. Their camp was
just outside the rock crevice which gave access to the inner cañon.
“Might’s well git us some hot coffee while we’re makin’ that fire. I’ll
rustle up some bresh along the slopes while you’re gittin’ the grub.
Little skillet layin’ in my pack for the side-meat. We got lots o’
time—they wont disciver our smoke until after sunup.”</p>

<p>He shuffled off toward the slopes on the right, and disappeared in the
darkness. Ramsay went to work at breakfast, preparing the coffee with the
last of their water and slicing up some bacon.</p>

<p>Getting some dry and dead twigs together, Ramsay heaped them in
readiness to build a fire. As he rose, a voice suddenly impinged sharply
on his consciousness.</p>

<p>“Up with ’em, stranger—reach high and quick!”</p>

<p>He put up his hands, and turned. There, standing at the rock opening
through which he must have come unobserved, stood the tall, stooped figure
of Gentleman Jimson, his pistol covering Ramsay.</p>

<p>“What you doing here?” demanded Jimson. “Who you looking for?”</p>

<p>His rifle out of reach, Ramsay knew himself caught. His brain worked
swiftly.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Tom Emery,” he said, raising his voice in order to
warn Sagebrush, whose proximity was evidently unsuspected.</p>

<p>“Oh, looking for Tom, are you?” Jimson sneered. “On what
business?”</p>

<p>“That’s for him to hear,” returned Ramsay. “Sidewinder told me to camp
here until morning. You’re Jimson, I s’pose?” The other was momentarily
astonished. “What! Sidewinder sent you here, did he? Where’s
Mesquite?”</p>

<p>“Gone to jail in Meteorite, I guess. That greaser with him was
killed.”</p>

<p>“What!” Jimson looked startled; then he frowned. “You’re a cussed liar!
What’s this you’re pulling off, anyhow? Sidewinder would never have told
you to wait out here before telling us all this. March over here—leave
that rifle where it lays! Quick, now, or I’ll drill you!”</p>

<p class='mt10'>The voices had risen shrill and distinct on the quiet air
of the dawn, and had quite accomplished the purpose for which Ramsay
hoped. Jimson caught a movement on the hillside from the corner of his
eye, and turned—but his pistol did not swing quickly enough. The roar of a
forty-five crashed out, then again. Gentleman Jimson, with a look of
frightful astonishment, dropped his automatic, took two staggering steps,
then slumped face down.</p>

<p>Sagebrush, standing on the hillside to the right, emitted a whoop of
exultation.</p>

<p>“Ye will crowd me and my pardner, will ye? Reckon that’s one reward
I’ll collect.” Suddenly his voice rose shrill. “Hey, Per-fesser! Look
out—hosses comin’!”</p>

<p>Ramsay, already scrambling for his rifle, heard the pounding of many
hoofs and sprang up, wildly startled by that shrill cry. He saw, coming in
upon him from the desert, a mass of horses. One glance at Sagebrush, and
he caught sight of the latter staggering out of sight—then rifles cracked.
A bullet sang past his head.</p>

<p>With a leap, Ramsay darted toward his only protection, the hole in the
wall. He jumped the motionless body of Jimson, turned, and began firing.
The scream of a frantic horse answered his first shot; then bullets began
to whang on the rock around him. He saw that a dozen or more horses were
charging in, had a vision of two men firing; then he slipped back into the
ten-foot passage, with the rush of animals at his very heels.</p>

<p>As he ran for the other side, a curse broke from his lips. Sagebrush
was shot down, and their whole scheme of action was disrupted. It was
plain enough that two of the gang were returning with stolen horses—</p>

<p>They were upon him, and nothing saved him from trampling but a hasty
shot from under his arm. At the report, a horse leaped high and then came
down kicking. Something struck Ramsay as he gained the inner opening of
the passage, struck him and sent him headlong to one side. He crashed
down, rolled over, picked himself up. A rifle roared above him; the bullet
sang by his face; and as he himself fired, he had a swift vision of a
bearded rider flinging out arms and pitching forward. Then he was working
the bolt, looking for the other horsethief, as the rush of animals swept
past and went pounding up the grassy cañon. No other appeared.</p>

<p>Ramsay stood panting, waiting, rifle ready. Twenty feet away lay the
outlaw he had shot from the saddle—but where was the other? From the other
end of the cañon lifted faint shouts of men; the gang there were alarmed,
but it was still too dark for them to make out anything.</p>

<p>Something flickered from the black depths of the passage. Before Ramsay
could comprehend its import, a lariat settled over his shoulders and was
jerked taut. He was fighting it instantly, trying to whip around his
rifle—fighting it furiously, fiercely, vainly. A hoarse laugh made answer;
then he was drawn off his feet and hurled sprawling. Next instant, a horse
came leaping through the opening and started away, the rider holding the
rope with Ramsay dragging behind.</p>

<p class='mt10'>In the space of a few seconds terrible things can come to
pass. Arms caught just above his elbows and fast bound to his body with
the rope cutting into the flesh, Ramsay was dragged along for half a
minute, jerking and helpless, clothes ripped away, death threatening with
every rock that loomed in his path; he came to the grass, slid over it
more easily, heard the outlaw yelling at his mount to increase its
speed—and all the while held on to his rifle, though it was nearly torn
from his hand.</p>

<p>And then came a merciful relaxation. The horse stumbled suddenly, was
reined sharply in—the lariat slackened. Ramsay rolled over on his side,
gained his feet with a leap, cocked and fired the rifle from his hip. It
was a chance shot, but a good one. The poor horse sank forward. Its outlaw
rider, leaping from the saddle, turned and threw up a pistol. But Ramsay,
working up the lariat, had ejected the shell and now fired again. The
outlaw pitched forward on his face, shot through the brain.</p>

<p>All this took place with incredible rapidity. Indeed, it must have
passed swiftly, for no man can long survive the dragging at a lariat’s
end. As it was, Ramsay knew himself bruised and hurt, torn and
scratched—but in essentials undamaged. He was not thirty yards from the
passage, and turned to it. As he did so, that dark cleft in the rock wall
vomited a spat of flame, and to the smashing report of a pistol, a bullet
whined past him.</p>

<p>Instantly Ramsay whirled, threw himself at the dead horse, gained it,
and took shelter. Another report, and another bullet went screaming over
him. He answered it with a blind shot. Panting, he realized his
intolerable position. He was out here in the open, trapped, and from the
shouts at the other end of the cañon, he knew the three men there would
soon be sweeping down on him. Swiftly he weighed the chances for a dash
toward one of the side slopes—and then he saw a grim thing, yet one which
spelled his salvation.</p>

<p>He had supposed that these shots from the passage must have come from a
third horsethief. Now he perceived a figure take shape in the grayness,
and was about to fire when he saw it staggering forward, and checked
himself. It was the tall figure of Jimson, mortally wounded and yet still
alive, blindly reeling on, pistol in hand. As Ramsay waited, the pistol
dropped. For a moment Jimson stood there, swaying, then dropped slowly to
his knees and fell in a limp heap.</p>

<p>In a flash, Ramsay visualized what was now sure to take place. It was
his one chance, and a sure chance. None of those three outlaws at the head
of the cañon would know what had happened here. He leaped up, and imagined
that he could see riders coming from the gray background of the cañon.
That he was unseen, he knew well enough. Next instant he was running for
the heaped-up rocks near the passage. As he went by Jimson, he saw the
dying man was still alive and trying to rise, but kept on, and a moment
later threw himself down in cover of the boulders.</p>

<p>“No time to ask after Sagebrush now—here’s the great chance to clean
up the whole gang!” he thought, as he reloaded his rifle and drew long
deep breaths to calm himself. “By glory, we haven’t done so badly so far,
either! Three of them done for now. They came asking for it, and they got
it. If things work right, I’ll get these last three scoundrels alive—ah!
They’re coming, all right.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>He waited, eyes glittering, bloody and bruised figure
tense, rifle ready. Now the gray darkness was clearing off, and the
clearer light of day was breaking through. Coming across the grassy cañon
at a breakneck gallop were three riders, impeded at first by the mass of
frightened and rushing horses. Now, free of the remuda, the three were
plunging toward the passage and the three outstretched figures lying there
in the open; one of those figures was moving, slowly crawling upward.
Jimson, dying hard, got to one knee and remained thus, swaying.</p>

<p>The three outlaws swept on, straight for the figure of Jimson, and the
man in the lead was Tom Emery, his mass of flaming whiskers marking him
clearly. All three had rifles and were girded with gun-belts. Ramsay
grinned excitedly as he waited, out of sight.</p>

<p>“They don’t know what’s happened!” he thought in exultation. “Jimson is
baiting them right into the trap—”</p>

<p>Jimson was not forty feet away from him, and the three outlaws came
thundering down with shouted queries and wild oaths of rage. As they drew
closer, Ramsay could see them looking from Jimson to the girdling masses
of rock, and knew that he was out of their sight. Tom Emery was in the
lead, riding like a Centaur, his face like a red blur; behind him were the
sullen, scowling Ximines and the more dapper halfbreed Cholo Bill, eyes
glittering like dots of jet.</p>

<p>They came hurtling down upon Jimson, threw themselves from the saddle
and gathered around him with a burst of excited speech. But they came too
late; for Jimson, swaying, toppled over as they reached him, and lay
quiet—this time forever. The three stared one at another, but only for an
instant.</p>

<p>“Stick ’em up—<i>pronto</i>!” commanded Ramsay’s voice. “Drop the
rifles.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>A raging oath burst from Emery. All three turned, facing the rock
wall and the passage; dismounted, caught in the open, their three dead
comrades to serve as warning, they comprehended instantly that they were
trapped, snared mercilessly. In silence they obeyed the mandate, but their
faces were eloquent as they dropped the rifles and elevated their
arms.</p>

<p>“Tom Emery,” continued Ramsay, his voice cool and deadly in its slight
drawl, “you and Cholo Bill are wanted for the murder of Alec Ramsay last
year. Ximines, you can come along on general principles. You take your own
pistol and drop it overboard, then relieve your two friends of their
weapons. Leave ’em all in a pile. I don’t need much of an excuse to put a
bullet into you, so watch out you don’t give it to me.”</p>

<p>The scowling Mexican deposited his own pistol and those of the others
in the dust.</p>

<p>“Now step forward!” Ramsay rose, rifle at his shoulder. “Step forward,
please! All three—that’s right. Walk right through the hole in the wall,
and don’t walk too fast. The hand is quicker than the foot, gentlemen. Now
into the hole—you first, señor Ximines, then Cholo Bill, and Mr. Emery
last. Close together, and slowly.”</p>

<p>He strode forward as the three came to the passage that gave on to the
outer cañon. Their eyes glittered on him with unspeakable rage, but they
said not a word. In the order assigned, they entered the cleft, and Ramsay
brought up the rear with the muzzle of his rifle thrust against the back
of the gigantic Emery, whose red whiskers were bristling with suppressed
fury. Ramsay chuckled, as he marched them forward.</p>

<p>“I expect you’re due for a shave before long, Mr. Emery, and a free
haircut to boot. Keep right ahead of each other, gentlemen, and walk
straight out into the daylight. When you are safely taken care of, well
all start out and have a nice little walk over to town, and interview Mr.
Crowfoot. Now, everybody, four steps forward, then halt and
about-face.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>By this time the full morning light was spreading over
everything, and the three captives left the rock-cleft and marched forward
as directed. Ramsay, not daring to take his eyes from them, followed for a
pace or two and then halted as they turned and faced his rifle. For a
moment he met the savage gaze of Emery—then the latter suddenly looked
up, behind Ramsay, and his eyes widened in surprise.</p>

<p>Ramsay cast one startled glance over his shoulder. He saw, to his utter
consternation, a horse close pressed against the rock wall to the left of
the opening; and holding the reins in one hand, and in the other a leveled
pistol—Sidewinder Crowfoot. For an instant those glittery gray eyes held
Ramsay paralyzed.</p>

<p>“Careful with that gun!” warned Sidewinder, a deadly whine to his
voice. “Grab it, Tom. Then grab this gent—and do it careful. He’s got to
do some talkin’ real soon. Tie him up and leave him be.” Ramsay knew
better than to resist. Utterly dismayed, dumbfounded by the simple manner
in which he had been trapped in the very moment of victory, he let himself
be seized, hurled to the ground, and then none too gently be bound hand
and foot. A swift search, and he was disarmed.</p>

<p>A flood of curses burst loose, and for a moment he thought the Mexican
would stamp on him in rage, but Sidewinder interfered and quieted the
noise.</p>

<p>“What’s happened here?” he snapped. Emery made profane response.</p>

<p>“Dunno! The boys come in with them hosses they went after, but they
come dead. Jimson come out to meet ’em, and he’s dead. This feller jumps
us. Says we’re wanted for killin’ Ramsay last year. What is he—sheriff or
detective?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll find out,” said Sidewinder. “He sure played hell
around here, didn’t he? Well, I’m dead for something to eat. Any of his
friends around?”</p>

<p>“Nope. I reckon he done played a lone hand,” said Emery,
not without a trace of admiration. “You aint seen no one out here?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sidewinder. “Nary a sign. This hoss of mine is clear done up
and staggering. I seen what happened from the passage, and come back to
lay for him—and got him. Tom, take charge of him and walk him in. I’ll
take your hoss and ride over to camp. This gent has played hell in town as
well as here. I been on my way since yesterday noon—had to come all the
way on hossback. Leave the hoss here—he’ll wander in after he comes
around. All ready, boys—let’s go!”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Emery jerked Ramsay to his feet, cast loose his ankles,
and propelled him forward into the passage; he went dumbly, unresisting,
appalled by the disaster which had overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>Behind them, the outer cañon was empty of life save for the horse which
Sidewinder had ridden, and which stood with legs wide apart, head
drooping, exhausted and spent. Red and gold streaked across the sky, as
the first fingers of sunrise reached up to the zenith. Presently the
horse, still saddled and bridled, made a convulsive movement and came out
from among the rocks, and stood, white with lather. He was still standing
there twenty minutes later, when the first rays of sunlight struck down
from the hilltops and smote all the desert spaces into gold and purple,
and up on the hillside stirred something that presently took definite
shape. This was Sagebrush Beam.</p>

<p>The desert rat painfully gained his feet, staggered forward, lost his
balance and came sprawling down among the rocks. He lay quiet for a while,
blood spreading across the grizzled expanse of his tangled beard. Then,
warmed by the sun, he lifted himself again, feebly gained his feet, and
came tottering across the sand to where the horse stood watching him. For
a little he clung to the saddle, helpless. After a time he made an effort
to draw himself up, cursed vividly if weakly, and at the second effort
made shift to mount.</p>

<p>The exhausted horse submitted to its fate and started out into the
desert, with Sagebrush limp and clinging to the pommel.</p>

<h2 title='X' id='chX'>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>The three shacks at the head of Hourglass Cañon were set amid trees and
near a trickling brook, which in another three weeks would be only a
summer’s memory, and which was lost in the grass a hundred yards distant.
Ramsay was allowed to sit against a tree, and was set free of his bonds,
while his four captors surrounded him. The two frightened Mexican women,
wretched creatures who belonged to Ximines and Cholo Bill, fetched coffee
and tortillas.</p>

<p>Ramsay had been studying his captors. Ximines was the most dangerous,
because the most vicious and debased Cholo Bill was far above him in
character. Tom Emery had some traces of humor in his brutal countenance.
All three of them were distinctly perturbed and uneasy, yet deferred
everything to Sidewinder. And Ramsay perceived that Crowfoot himself,
beneath that grayish mask of a face, was more alarmed than he cared to
betray.</p>

<p>“Now, you going to talk or do we got to make ye?” demanded Sidewinder,
his reptilian gaze fastened on Ramsay. The latter smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“You give me a share in your breakfast and let me get my pipe going,
and I’ll swap all the information you want.”</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” grunted Sidewinder, and summoned one of the women.</p>

<p class='mt10'>Ramsay found his tortillas excellent and the coffee
passable, and attacked his breakfast heartily. His chief concern was for
Sagebrush. The latter was either dead, in which case he could not be
aided, or else was wounded, in which case he was better off without
Sidewinder’s help; in either event, his participation in the morning’s
affair was not suspected and must not be suspected. In all other respects,
frank speech was the best policy.</p>

<p>The meal finished, Ramsay got his pipe going while the other four
rolled cigarettes, and Sidewinder started his catechism.</p>

<p>“First off, what kind of an officer are you, anyhow? County, State or
Fed’ral?”</p>

<p>“Neither one,” Ramsay chuckled. “My name’s Pat Ramsay. I came
here to get Mr. Emery yonder, also Cholo Bill, for the murder of my
brother Alec last year. You were a party to it also.”</p>

<p>Emery started to speak, but Sidewinder flashed him a look that held him
silent.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t no murder,” said Sidewinder. “It was a straight
killin’—”</p>

<p>“No use passing any lies,” said Ramsay quietly. “Let’s all stick to the
truth. Alec left a message for me, also the deed to that property he
bought from Harrison—told me all about it. I found ’em in Pinecate Cañon
the other day. The deed’s gone in to the recorder’s office. So has an
explanation of the circumstances. I expect the sheriff will be along any
time to look things over.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>An outburst of startled oaths broke from the three outlaws, but
Sidewinder only grinned and put a hand to his pocket. He drew forth an
unopened letter. Ramsay, in dismay, recognized it as that containing the
deed, which he had registered with Haywire Johnson.</p>

<p>“Here y’are,” said Sidewinder, and tossed it to him with a malignant
grin. “I reckon ye might’s well keep it. Serve for identification. Darned
good thing I took a look through that mail-sack ’fore it went out
yesterday, eh? What’d you do to Hassayamp, anyhow? He got Miss Gilman’s
money, took Mesquite’s hoss and beat it for parts unknown.”</p>

<p>Ramsay, although he flinched under the blow, rallied quickly.</p>

<p>“I jogged his memory about a job he pulled off down in Arizona before
coming here.”</p>

<p>“And ye sure give Mesquite a scare. Reckon he’s still goin’. So you
aint no officer, th? You just come nosing in here on your own hook, eh?
Well, you’ve sure played hell. I wonder how you can set there and eat and
smoke and laugh, after wipin’ out three good men this morning! Aint you
got no conscience? Don’t it mean nothin’ to you that ye’ve killed three
men?”</p>

<p>Ramsay shrugged.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t worry you to bring in people from outside and cheat them or
murder them, does it?” he retorted. “And it doesn’t worry anyone to wipe
out a rattler. You fellows and desert rattlers are about in the same
class.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be in the same class with your brother when we get through
with ye,” said Sidewinder acidly.</p>

<p>“He knows too much,” said Ximines in Spanish. “Kill him now,
quickly.”</p>

<p>“You back down and rest your heels,” snapped Sidewinder. “I’m running
this show. Now, Ramsay, you’re alone in this deal—you and Miss
Gilman—”</p>

<p>“She’s not in it,” broke out Ramsay quickly, alarmed by the man’s
look.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye lie to me! You and her have been carryin’ on together. Got to
town about the same time, and been thick ever since. She fooled me at
first, all right, but now I’m wide awake and ready to strike. You’ve
earned your victuals. Now shut up.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>With this, Sidewinder turned to the three outlaws and briefly described
Miss Gilman’s activities, while Ramsay listened in acute anxiety.</p>

<p>“All good things have an end,” he finished. “We’ve just about reached
the end of our rope. The thing to do now is to bust up camp. Better get
them women and the kid off right now, with hosses. Let ’em ride in to
town, and José Garcia will take care of ’em until you’re ready to send for
’em. Then get busy with a running-iron and a knife, and we’ll go over them
hosses on hand. Any that can’t be worked over, leave here. You’ll have a
right good remuda, and you three fellers can run ’em up to Silver City.
Emery, you know how to get there across the Salt Pans, don’t ye?”</p>

<p>Tom Emery nodded in silence, but jerked his thumb at Ramsay.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry none about him. First, get them women off. Then get busy
with the irons. We’ll be until night gettin’ the remuda worked over and in
good shape. Then, early in the morning, we’ll ride over to Pinecate Cañon
with this inquisitive pilgrim. That fool woman is goin’ out there sometime
today, to camp and see about where to build a shack. We’ll nab her and her
car.&#160;—Hey, Ramsay! Where’s that rat Sagebrush?”</p>

<p>“Last I saw of him was out in the desert,” said Ramsay truthfully. “He
didn’t fancy any acquaintance with Miss Gilman, and got right huffy over
her being around.”</p>

<p>“So he run off, eh? Blamed if that aint old Sagebrush
all over!” Sidewinder chuckled dryly. “Where’s your car?”</p>

<p>“At Pinecate Cañon.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Sidewinder eyed his three men. “Ye see, we can’t afford to
take no chances. If we kill this <i>hombre</i>, there may be questions
asked—and what’d we do with the Gilman woman? I don’t aim to murder a
woman.”</p>

<p>“Give her to me,” suggested Ximines, with a grin.</p>

<p>“You go plumb to hell,” snapped Sidewinder. “I don’t guess any of us
want a double murder charge follering us. So here’s the program with them
two: Leave ’em in Pinecate Cañon, with some grub. They aint going to walk
away from there in a hurry—”</p>

<p>“Hamstring him!” Ximines gave Ramsay a scowling glance.</p>

<p>“Good idea,” approved Sidewinder, with a nod. “Fix him so’s he can’t
travel, anyhow. Then I’ll have José Garcia come over there from town and
camp out to keep an eye on the two of ’em. You boys run the remuda up to
Silver City, sell her, and then scatter. I’ll get sold out in Stovepipe
Springs, and disappear. Three weeks ought to fix us up all around. Then
Garcia can remove himself likewise. By the time Ramsay and that fool woman
get out to where they can tell their story—let ’em tell it! That’s the
general scheme. We can fix the details later. How’s it suit?”</p>

<p>“Fine with me,” said Tom Emery, pawing his red whiskers.</p>

<p>Cholo Bill nodded. “<i>Bueno!</i> But my woman, she go with me and the
remuda.”</p>

<p>“Mine too,” growled Ximines.</p>

<p>“Then get busy.” Sidewinder rose. “Tie up this gent.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Ramsay, despite his protestations, was seized and lashed
firmly to a tree, after which he was ignored for the remainder of the
morning. He was somewhat relieved by the exposition of Sidewinder’s plans,
since these did not at least include murder; this relief was more than
balanced, however, by the menace directed toward Ethel Gilman.</p>

<p>The hours dragged past, while Sidewinder and his three companions
worked like slaves. The entire band of horses, numbering nearly forty, had
to be gone over. Each animal had to be examined carefully, and his brand
worked upon with running irons to make it accord with the brands used by
Sidewinder, while the other marks also had to be altered to suit.</p>

<p>There was an hour’s lay-off at noon, when Ramsay was given temporary
liberty. Then he was closely confined again, and the work went on. Five of
the unavailable horses were turned into a small corral behind the shacks,
and one of the women was sent to the outer cañon to bring in the horse
which Sidewinder had left there. She returned later with word that the
animal had wandered off out of sight.</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset when the work was concluded, and the four men,
weary to the point of exhaustion, came in and flung themselves down. The
two women had prepared a meal which was eaten hurriedly; then Ramsay, who
had been released temporarily, was again bound and relegated to his post
against the tree. Ordering the women to wake them at midnight, Sidewinder
and the others rolled up and were asleep at once.</p>

<p>Benumbed by his many and tight lashings, stiff and sore with his hurts
and bruises, Ramsay resigned himself to the inevitable, and after a little
dropped off into a doze. From this he was wakened to find Ximines cutting
him free and playfully jabbing him with the point of a knife as he
cut.</p>

<p>“So, leetle señor, you come weeth me, eh?” In the starry darkness the
white teeth of the swarthy Mexican outlaw flashed faintly. “You ride with
Manuel,” continued the man in Spanish, which Ramsay comprehended
perfectly. “And while you ride <i>conmigo</i>, we shall talk, eh?”</p>

<p>Ramsay, rubbing his stiffened limbs, glanced around and saw that they
were alone. He gathered his muscles—</p>

<p>“Careful, señor!” The muzzle of a pistol touched him. “Turn and walk
to the horses.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars and a get-away, Ximines,” he said softly, “if you
turn me free.”</p>

<p>The other growled. “Bah! If you have that much money, I shall take it
anyway, and take the pretty señorita too! When we get to that cañon of
<i>pinecates</i> eh? Then this Sidewinder will go away, and maybe Manuel
will come back, eh? And you will not be able to object, my little señor.
<i>Vamanos!</i> To the horses!”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Sidewinder called. Ramsay, hopeless, turned and went to
the horses, saddled by the other men. He was put into a saddle, his feet
roped to the stirrups, and his arms bound. Then Ximines, without orders
but for reasons of his own, improvised a dirty bandana into a gag, which
he lashed about the jaw of Ramsay.</p>

<p>“Bring him along,” said Sidewinder impatiently, and mounted, leading
the way. The others trailed out after him. After Cholo Bill rode Ramsay,
the reins of his horse held by Ximines at his stirrup. As they rode out
across the grassy cañon, the Mexican laughed and spoke softly to the
captive.</p>

<p>“Ho, little señor! What is it I read in the newspaper, that the wise
men say in your town of New York, eh? They say that the <i>Americano</i>,
he is not civilized—that the <i>Americano</i> of the West, he is an
animal. Ho! Well, when I come back to that cañon of the little tumbling
bugs, señor, you shall see how we treat gringos, dogs of
<i>Americanos</i>, in my country! And you will not be able to walk, for I
shall cut your legs behind—<i>que lástima</i>. What a pity, little señor!
And when I kiss the señorita, eh? It will be amusing to hear you curse,
uncivilized <i>Americano</i>!”</p>

<p>Ramsay now perceived why he had been gagged by the Mexican. And beneath
the raging fury that the taunts and threats roused in him, beneath wonder
that on the lips of such a man he should find the smart sayings of the
radicals of New York’s East Side, slowly mounted a growing horror at the
prospect. For he comprehended that this swarthy Mexican, whose cigarettes
had such a queer and unholy odor, was a smoker of the marihuana weed—a
monster beside whom the cocaine fiend was as a pale angel, a creature
debased and degenerate whose one craving was for blood, for cruelty, for
torture.</p>

<p>So the five riders passed through the hole in the wall, and came out
upon the lonely starlit desert, and headed for the Pinecate mesa. And upon
the hills the coyotes howled dismal orisons to the stars.</p>

<h2 title='XI' id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>Another dawn was breaking when the five riders approached Pinecate
Cañon, and the sun-spears were thrusting across the eastern sky. The lower
reaches of the rocky cañon were desolate and empty, save for the figure of
a saddled and bridled horse moving about. Sidewinder, with a grunt of
recognition, broke the silence.</p>

<p>“There’s that cayuse of Mesquite’s now—started for town and stopped on
the way. Prob’ly smelled water here.”</p>

<p>“And yonder’s the auto,” said Tom Emery with a jerk of his head. “Two
of ’em!”</p>

<p>There was no need to question Ramsay about his car, for that of Ethel
Gilman had been thrust beside it into the cover of the trees and mesquite
clump, so that both cars stood protected from sun and dew, but plain to be
seen. Sidewinder flung them a glance, then turned his horse into the
cañon.</p>

<p>“Come along—ride as far as we can, anyhow. Her place is quite a ways
up.”</p>

<p>The five rode slowly up the cañon, until they came to the spot where
Ramsay had found that cigarette case. Here Sidewinder drew rein, since it
was becoming increasingly harder for the horses to climb. Ahead was the
bend in the cañon.</p>

<p>“Manuel, you stay here with Ramsay. You’d better stick here too, Tom.
Come ahead when I call. You come with me, Bill.”</p>

<p>Sidewinder dismounted, and with the dapper Cholo Bill swinging along
beside him, ascended the rocky floor of the cañon on foot. A faint thread
of smoke began climbing into the sky from somewhere around the bend;
sunrise in all its glory was spreading a riot of color across the
heavens.</p>

<p>Some distance above them was a great boulder, huge as a house, in the
center of the rapidly narrowing cañon. It was a rich and ruddy rose-pink
in the first sunlight, and was split squarely in two, with a number of
small piñon trees growing from the split. Water came from it, came from
the cañon above it also, and ran down into several pools and short falls;
it was the evanescent water of the desert springtime, giving a short-lived
existence to lilies and masses of flowers on either hand. Above this
boulder, and to its left, could be seen the brown outline of a small tent,
with the figure of Ethel Gilman tending a fire close by. Sidewinder raised
his voice in a hail, and waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Leave the talk to me, now,” he growled. “It’s all right—she’s alone
here. Don’t want to frighten her. Scare a fool woman, and she’s like a
locoed horse.”</p>

<p>“<i>Seguro, señor</i>,” assented the halfbreed with a flash of his white
teeth. Sidewinder, now that the girl had seen them, turned and sent a
stentorian hail down the cañon, bidding Emery come along up. Then he
started climbing again to where the girl stood beside her little fire,
staring at the arrivals in alarm and fear that could not be wholly
veiled.</p>

<p>“Morning, miss,” called Sidewinder as they approached her camp. “How’s
everything?”</p>

<p>“All right, thanks,” she returned, low-voiced, obviously startled.</p>

<p>“I was goin’ by with some friends o’ mine,” said Sidewinder, puffing
with the climb, “and thought we’d stop in and see if you were all
right.&#160;—Bill, rustle up some firewood for the lady!”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Cholo Bill smiled and went about his task.
Sidewinder approached the girl.</p>

<p>“We’re going to leave Ramsay with you a spell,” he said. “He’s a mite
scratched up, but aint hurt to speak of. Fell off a hoss, I reckon. Miss,
where’s that pistol of yours? Let’s have a look at it.”</p>

<p>He did not miss her start at Ramsay’s name. His gray eyes glittered on
her, bored into her, and as she met that deadly gaze, there was a struggle
in her face.</p>

<p>“You want—my pistol?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Her hand went to her bosom and produced a small, flat automatic. Still
she hesitated, a surge of anger coming into her eyes—then as she looked
past Sidewinder, she saw the other three figures turning the bend. At once
she held out the weapon.</p>

<p>“There. Now what? You need not pretend that you want to help me.”</p>

<p>Sidewinder took the weapon and thrust it out of sight.</p>

<p>“We aint goin’ to hurt ye, not a mite,” he said harshly. “We got Ramsay
where we want him, and neither one of ye is going to do any talkin’;
that’s all. We’re goin’ to leave him and you here, and fix it so’s ye’ll
stay here a spell. Nothin’ to be scared of, miss. If you’ve got any grub,
let’s have some. I’ll send ye out plenty from town, as soon as we get
back. The water’ll last ye long enough, so there’s nothin’ to be scared
of.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get what I have,” she said quietly, then turned and went into the
tent—whence she presently reappeared, with coffee and bacon, coffee-pot
and skillet. Cholo Bill came in with an armload of brush, which he heaped
over the fire, arranging several stones to hold the coffee-pot. A moment
later Tom Emery strode up, followed by Ximines and Ramsay, who was still
gagged and his arms bound. Miss Gilman stood staring at him,
wide-eyed—this scratched and bruised and helpless man, with the garments
hanging in shreds about him, was somewhat different from the Pat Ramsay
she had known previously.</p>

<p>“I reckon he needs a shave, ma’am.” Sidewinder chuckled. “But that’ll
keep. Set him against that rock, Manuel. The lady can let him loose after
we’re gone. Get some water, Tom—the quicker we get a bite to eat and get
off, the better.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>Disregarding their curious glances, Miss Gilman, looking
only at the figure of Ramsay, returned to her tent and sat down before it.
Sidewinder and his companions managed a makeshift bite to eat and a
swallow of warm coffee apiece; then Sidewinder rose.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave the hosses here. Which of you boys can drive a car? Got to
take ’em both to town with us.”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Tom Emery.</p>

<p>“All right—”</p>

<p>“Somebody better stay and watch things, and attend to the horses,”
spoke up Manuel Ximines, who was rolling one of his evil-smelling
cigarettes. “It would be foolish to leave horses here. Why not let me
stay? I have nothing to do in town.”</p>

<p>Sidewinder nodded, with a slight look of chagrin at the slip he had so
nearly made. To have left the horses here unwatched would indeed have been
fatal.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said curtly. “You stay. Don’t bother the lady none.
Better go on down to the lower cañon. I’ll send a driver back with the
other boys and a load of grub in one o’ the cars. Then you boys get back
to Hourglass in a hurry, and get started. I’ll have José Garcia out here
by morning to ride herd on things.”</p>

<p>“And shall I hamstring this <i>hombre</i> now?” asked Ximines,
gesturing with his cigarette toward Ramsay, who was glad that Miss Gilman
could not understand the Mexican tongue.</p>

<p>“Let him wait till tonight. You’ll likely need help to hold him down,
and we aint got any time to waste now. Come on, boys.”</p>

<p>With this, Sidewinder started down the cañon, Tom Emery and Cholo Bill
at his heels. Manuel Ximines, however, remained sitting where he was, a
thin smile on his black-avised features, in his glittering dark eyes the
wild cruelty and the cunning that mark the <i>marihuana</i>-smoker.</p>

<p class='mt10'>Not until the three departing figures were out of sight
around the bend did the girl move. Then, as Ximines showed no intention of
leaving, she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“Well?” she demanded sharply. “I suppose I may release Mr. Ramsay?”</p>

<p>Ximines turned his head and surveyed her. Under that gaze she shrank,
and the color ebbed from her cheeks.</p>

<p>“You stay quiet or I shoot heem.” With this, the Mexican resumed his
cigarette and stared again down the cañon.</p>

<p>The girl flashed a terrified, wondering look at Ramsay, who had drawn
closer a step or two. His eyes, vainly trying to give her a message of
warning, terrified her the more, and she stood motionless before the tent.
Ximines, who perhaps wanted to let Sidewinder and the other two men get
well away, paid her no attention but smoked on reflectively and stared
down the cañon. He had drawn his pistol, however, and now held it idly in
his lap.</p>

<p>Ramsay, arms bound and gagged as he was, was more terrified than the
girl. He knew that Ximines might at any instant leap into stark
blood-madness or wild passion. Alienists declare that the man who thinks
himself about to explode is the most dangerous of all maniacs; but men on
the border know that more dangerous than any maniac is the smoker of
<i>marihuana</i>. So, with the intention of quietly working his way toward
the girl, in a desperate hope that she might be able to release his bound
arms, Ramsay continued his slow forward advance.</p>

<p>Then, sudden as the flashing stroke of a snake, Ximines was on his
feet, pistol out.</p>

<p>“One more step, little señor, and I cut your throat and drink your
blood!” he exclaimed, a wild and lurid glare in his eyes. A cry broke
from the girl.</p>

<p>“Stop! Leave us alone—go on down and look after those horses!” She
faced him as he turned to her, grinning. Despite the terror that was upon
her, she met his grin defiantly, bravely. “Go on down the cañon as you
were told to do!”</p>

<p>Ximines thrust away his pistol and took a step toward her, glaring eyes
gripped upon her.</p>

<p>“Manuel has come to take you, little señorita of the white throat,” he
declared in soft Spanish, and if the girl could not understand his words,
his manner was beyond all mistake. “Come to me, little cooing dove! I
shall show you how we treat the gringo señoritas in my country.”</p>

<p>Ramsay hurled himself forward, frantic with horror, flung himself at
the Mexican. Ximines grinned, avoided the rush, deftly tripped the bound
man and then struck him with an open-handed blow that sent him headlong
among the rocks. Next instant, with a sudden and unexpected lurch forward,
he was upon Ethel Gilman and had caught her in both arms.</p>

<p>“Come, señorita—”</p>

<p>She struck him across the face, staggering him, and struck him again so
that he loosed her and fell back, hand to eyes. A wild scream burst from
him, and he whipped out a knife, swaying as he stood.</p>

<p>“Ha! I shall drink your blood for that blow, white-throat!” he
yelled.</p>

<p>Ramsay, pulling himself up, saw the Mexican start forward, knew himself
helpless to intervene; then he saw something else.</p>

<p>The flap of the brown tent was shoved aside, and in the opening
protruded the red nose, the tangled whiskers, the sharp little eyes of
Sagebrush Beam. The Mexican saw that movement also, and furious as he was,
halted and shifted hand to pistol. But he was too late.</p>

<p>“I reckon ye’ve crowded us far enough,” growled Sagebrush.
The roar of a forty-five barked out, and lifted thunderously along the
cañon walls.</p>

<h2 title='XII' id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Sagebrush, dragging himself from the tent but not rising, called to
Ramsay.</p>

<p>“Kick that skunk’s knife over yere, and I’ll cut ye free.”</p>

<p>Ramsay, who had been stupefied by the appearance of the desert rat,
obeyed the order, and in another moment was rubbing his arms to get rid of
the numbness. Ethel Gilman had dropped in a heap, mercifully unconscious;
and almost at her side lay Manuel Ximines, his contorted features staring
at the sky.</p>

<p>“Where on earth did you come from?” demanded Ramsay. “Man, I thought
you were dead!”</p>

<p>“So I was,” and Sagebrush chuckled, “but I come to life again, found a
hoss and got over yere. The lady give me a lift up the cañon and took care
on me. I got a busted head and a bullet in the gizzard, but I’m gettin’
all right. Yessir! Like Yavapai Ferris, down Phœnix way. Time o’ the
border raids, some greasers drapped him into a dry wash with two-three
bullets; then some sojers come along, and the greasers crawled into the
wash for shelter, and Yavapai set up with a gun in each hand and plugged
ten of ’em. The ’leventh got away, and Yavapai said he’d ha’ been cured
pronto if he’d got the ’leventh. Yes-sir, same here. Pluggin’ that there
p’izen skunk sure done me good. I’d have done it earlier, only I didn’t
figger on drawin’ Sidewinder back yere. S’pose you drap him into the cañon
’fore the lady wakes up. Git his gun, too.”</p>

<p>Ramsay stooped above the dead Mexican and found that the latter’s
automatic was his own pistol, which had been taken from him when captured.
At one side of the upper flat was a great bunch of yucca, its spiny
perpendicular leaves topped by the remains of a glorious cluster of
creamy, bell-like blooms. Carrying the body to this, Ramsay dropped it out
of sight.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the spot,” said Sagebrush anxiously. “I reckon there’s a
reward for that gent down south.”</p>

<p>“Never mind talking now,” said Ramsay, with a glance at the unconscious
girl. “Got any more grub in there? Then lay it out—get breakfast started,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>He went to the pool below, sluiced head and neck and arms with
the cold water. Then he turned to the girl and lifted her head in his
arms. He was about to bathe her face, when her eyes opened and looked up
into his, startled and wide in recognition.</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” he said quietly, and smiled. “Sit still a minute,
young lady, and take it easy.”</p>

<p>Color rising in her cheeks, the girl sat up, then sprang to her feet,
staring around. “Where is he?”</p>

<p>“He done went away, ma’am,” said Sagebrush solemnly. “Yessir. That Mex
done seen the error of his ways and got converted. I never seen a Mex get
converted so sudden before, neither, nor with such good results.”</p>

<p>“And we owe Sagebrush a vote of thanks for converting him,” added
Ramsay, turning to the fire. “Breakfast ready in a minute, Miss Gilman.
Have you any biscuits cooked up?”</p>

<p>“Yere’s some store biscuits.” Sagebrush tossed out a package. “Say,
Perfesser! I’m right worried about somethin’.”</p>

<p>“About what?” asked Ramsay.</p>

<p>“Why, d’you s’pose that cuss Sidewinder will steal them magazines o’
mine? I left ’em to the hotel in my pack. I got six months’ store o’
magazines there, and I’m readin’ a long story in one of ’em. I been
thinking a lot about that there story in the last six months, and I’m
gettin’ real anxious to finish it. If Sidewinder steals ’em—”</p>

<p>“He wont,”
said Ramsay, laughing to himself. “He wont. I’ll nab those two friends of
his when they come back with the car this afternoon, and we’ll all drop in
on Sidewinder tonight and surprise him.” Sagebrush was sitting up, and
they joined him, all three feeling considerably benefited by the coffee
and a bite of food. Miss Gilman asked no more questions about Ximines, and
Ramsay outlined what had taken place in Hourglass Cañon.</p>

<p>“How badly is our friend here hurt?” Ramsay asked of Miss Gilman after
he had ended his story.</p>

<p>“He’ll be on his feet in a few days. I took out the bullet—I’ve had a
little experience nursing—and there’s nothing very much the matter with
him. He lost a good deal of blood.”</p>

<p>“Blood’s cheap.” Sagebrush grinned, as he leaned back comfortably. He
seemed to have quite gotten over all his aversion to this particular
woman. “Best thing for blood is good fat lizard-meat. I’ll get me a likely
chuckwalla and lay him in the ashes, and feed up. Some says pack-rats make
good meat, but I dunno. I’ve et rattlesnake, but my gosh! A feller has to
draw the line somewhere, and I draws it at pack-rats. So you’re figgering
on roundin’ up Sidewinder tonight, Perfesser?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Ramsay. “If I can get Tom Emery and Cholo Bill—”</p>

<p>“Ye can’t do it noways,” said Sagebrush with savage emphasis. “Don’t be
a durned fool and try it, Perfesser. Even if ye got them two fellers
covered, would they give in again? Not much. They’d figger that one of ’em
would go down, the other might plug ye—and they’d take the chance. Yessir.
After all that’s happened, they’d go for ye, gun or no gun. Ye took ’em by
s’prise the first time, but there wont be no second time. The only way to
get ’em is to drop ’em cold and get ’em dead.”</p>

<p>“I’m no murderer,” said Ramsay quietly. “And I’m going to get ’em, one
way or the other; so stop your argument. Miss Gilman, why didn’t you put
Sagebrush into your car and take him to town when he showed up here?”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t in shape to stand it,” said the girl. “He got here only last
night, half dead and very weak from loss of blood. I had to give him
instant attention, get out the bullet, and bandage him up. I should think
you’d compliment me on the recovery of my patient, instead of finding
fault!”</p>

<p>Ramsay smiled. “I’m not finding fault, except that I wish you were
out of here. Well, shall we go down and attend to those horses? We’d
better rid them of saddles and bridles and herd them as far up the cañon
as possible. We have until tonight to lay our plans, and we must get the
flivver that brings those rascals back here, as well as the two men
themselves.”</p>

<p>“Then ye’d better figger on shootin’ first and fastest,” snapped out
Sagebrush.</p>

<p class='mt10'>Ramsay laughed and made no response, as he started down
the cañon with Miss Gilman at his side. When they stood beside the great
boulder of pink granite, with the piñon trees growing out of the cleft
above, he paused.</p>

<p>“This is where my brother came,” he said, looking around. “I suppose
he’s buried somewhere near here—if he’s buried at all. And there’s gold
in these rocks.”</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful place,” said the girl softly, staring
at the pool with its great clusters of yucca flowers and lilies. “I
suppose these flowers will all be gone in a few weeks, Mr. Ramsay?”</p>

<p>He gave her a whimsical look. “Can’t you make it Pat, yet?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, gayly enough. “Not yet. Look up there above the
boulder—what a site that would be for a house!”</p>

<p>“You can have it,” he
said, starting on again. “I want none of this place—I’d never get away
from the thought of poor Alec. No, the place you should see is Hourglass
Cañon. There’s a real beauty-spot, with water the year around. If I were
you, I’d grubstake old Sagebrush, and set him to work looking for gold in
this cañon. My brother Alec was no fool, and if he thought there was gold
here in paying quantities, it is probably here. Then you come over to
Hourglass Cañon with me and start your chicken-ranch.”</p>

<p>She gave him a laughing look. “You own that other place, then?”</p>

<p>“No, but I will own it as soon as the papers can be put through. Do you
want half?”</p>

<p>“Tell you later,” she returned, and pointed. “There are the
horses.”</p>

<p class='mt10'>During the next half-hour Ramsay and Miss Gilman were busy
in the extreme. They unsaddled the five horses, got the poor beasts free
of bridles, and then started to drive them up the cañon as far as the
bend. Having found some of his own supplies lying cached among the trees,
Ramsay left the girl to handle the horses and himself turned back down to
the mouth of the cañon.</p>

<p>There, where the cañon gave on to the open desert, he approached the
clump of piñon and mesquite, and dragged forth the pack of supplies which
he had seen. It had evidently been flung out of his car by Sidewinder. He
stooped to open the pack and examine its contents—then he suddenly stood
up. A queer noise had startled him, a noise which made him glance
incredulously at the sky. An airplane?</p>

<p>No. He turned and stood transfixed. There, approaching at full speed,
leaping and bounding on the rough desert floor, was one of the two
vanished flivvers, and all three men were in it.</p>

<p>He stood staring, helpless, not daring to produce the pistol from his
pocket and open fire. That might have been his best chance; yet he
neglected it. With a grinding squeal of brakes, the car rushed down to a
halt ten feet away. Sidewinder leaped out in the cloud of dust, followed
by Tom Emery and Cholo Bill.</p>

<p>“Manuel! Where’s Ximines?” demanded Sidewinder hastily.</p>

<p>“Up the cañon.” Ramsay waved his hand. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Sidewinder turned to the two men, who had rifles in their hands.
Obviously, something very much was the matter, for they were pouring out
oaths at sight of the horses, and were in frantic haste.</p>

<p>“Go get Manuel and the hosses—quick!” snapped Sidewinder.
“This is as far as they can get in their car—we got the hosses, and they
aint got any. Move, durn ye!”</p>

<p>The two men stood their rifles against the car and started away, toward
the staring figure of Miss Gilman and the slowly moving horses.</p>

<h2 title='XIII' id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Sidewinder stood snarling malevolently at Ramsay, his glittering gray
eyes filled with a greenish light, his gray mask of a face bitter to
see.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” demanded Ramsay.</p>

<p>“Hell’s to pay, that’s what! If I thought you were behind it, I’d leave
you here to the buzzards. Dunno but what I will anyhow.”</p>

<p>Ramsay, frowning in perplexity, came closer to him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he inquired. Sidewinder flung out a hand toward the
desert behind him.</p>

<p>“I mean that the sheriff’s got on our trail; that’s what! Prob’ly
trailed that last bunch of hosses. Now we got to get along to Hourglass
Cañon, and we’ll take you and the girl so’s ye wont do no talkin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Ramsay, and then lifted his eyes to the desert. “Is that
dust caused by their car?”</p>

<p>An oath on his lips, Sidewinder whirled—and Ramsay struck.</p>

<p>He struck straight and hard, mercilessly so, and his fist caught
Sidewinder just behind the ear. The little man was knocked off his feet,
knocked headlong into the radiator of the car, and fell in a limp and
senseless heap, stunned.</p>

<p>Ramsay, carried off his balance by the furious energy of his own blow,
staggered. As he did so, a pistol barked and a bullet scraped his very
hair. He came around, to see Tom Emery and Cholo Bill, who were not yet
fifty feet away, in the act of firing on him.</p>

<p>A leap, and he was behind the car. No protection here from heavy
bullets—but he had his own pistol out now, and was taking his chances. A
bullet crashed into the frame of the car. Another smashed the windshield.
Ramsay was firing, rapidly but coolly. Now he ducked swiftly to the other
end of the car, darted out into full sight, took two quick, sure shots. He
saw Cholo Bill go down and lie quiet; then Emery came for him on the run,
red whiskers flaming in the sunlight, pistol spitting.</p>

<p>Ramsay stepped out, deliberately, and took aim.</p>

<p class='mt10'>A bullet streaked fire between arm and side, searing his
ribs—but to his shot Tom Emery’s giant figure came crashing forward,
rolled over once and then lay sprawled out. For a moment Ramsay stood
quiet, scarcely daring to realize that he was unhurt save for scratches,
until he saw Ethel Gilman running down the cañon toward him.</p>

<p>Then he sprang forward and leaned over Emery, only to rise at once and
hurry to the side of Cholo Bill. Just in time, too, for the halfbreed, leg
broken by a bullet, was trying to reach his fallen pistol. Ramsay kicked
the weapon away, and Cholo Bull, with a low groan, relaxed into
unconsciousness. As Ramsay obtained the outlaw’s knife, the girl arrived
on the scene.</p>

<p>He looked up at her with a slow laugh.</p>

<p>“Sagebrush said it couldn’t be done, but he was only partly right.
Emery’s gone. Can you fix up some sort of bandage for this chap, after I
get his arms lashed behind him? His leg’s broken, I think. The sheriff is
on his way here, according to Sidewinder—and I’ll have to attend to that
gentleman before he wakes up. We’ve got him, and we’ve got Cholo Bill, and
it’s a good haul.”</p>

<p>As the white-faced girl nodded and knelt, Ramsay lashed the arms of
the wounded man firmly behind him with the gay silk kerchief that had been
at Cholo Bill’s neck, then rose and ran back to the car. Here again he
had not an instant to lose, for Sidewinder Crowfoot was stirring, was
clinging to the car and trying to haul himself up. Knowing with what
incredible swiftness the man could strike, Ramsay did not hesitate, but
stooped with a blow that drove Sidewinder prostrate again, then flung
himself upon the fallen man and in five minutes had him disarmed and
firmly bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>He rejoined the girl, to find her finishing her task as well as
circumstances would permit, and as she took his hand to rise, he saw a
change come into her face.</p>

<p>“Another car—there!”</p>

<p>Ramsay swung around, and a laugh broke from him at sight of another
flivver bearing down for the cañon, crowded with men.</p>

<p>“Good! It looks as though the law had come to Pinecate Cañon at
last, young lady!”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes afterward Ramsay and the grizzled sheriff from
Chuckwalla City were accompanying Miss Gilman up the cañon toward the
girl’s camp, while below them the deputies were getting the prisoners
loaded up and were bringing the five horses to the cars. All five of
those horses had been among the bunch recently stolen from the other side
of the range, and two of the deputies were preparing to ride on to
Hourglass Cañon and take possession of the herd there.</p>

<p>As the three came to the bend in the cañon, Ramsay halted and
drew from his pocket his brother’s deed, still in its torn envelope.</p>

<p>“Sheriff, here’s evidence of a Federal charge to lay against Sidewinder
Crowfoot—mail-robbery. I think it will serve to give him a long time in
the penitentiary to think upon his sins. Suppose you look it over, while
I say a word to Miss Gilman, will you?”</p>

<p>The sheriff met his whimsical gaze, grinned, and then strode on around
the bend with the evidence in his hand. Ramsay turned to the girl.</p>

<p>“What do you say about Hourglass Cañon, young lady? Do you want to
share it with me?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go and look at it, but I wont promise anything.”</p>

<p>“All right. That’s fair enough. And you’ll call me Pat?”</p>

<p>Her eyes surveyed him merrily.</p>

<p>“Not until—you get a shave!” she said, and then was gone, running
after the tall figure of the sheriff, a laugh floating back to Ramsay.</p>

<p>He followed, smiling.</p>
